Fact-checking the Claim of Antifa Recruiting to Dress as Trump Supporters and Police for Rioting on Election Day 2020

A claim has circulated that Antifa, a far-left activist group, is recruiting individuals to disguise themselves as President Trump supporters and police officers with the intention of inciting violence and rioting on Election Day 2020 in the United States. However, a thorough examination of the evidence reveals that this claim is not supported by credible sources.

There is no concrete evidence from reputable news outlets or law enforcement agencies that suggests Antifa has orchestrated such a recruitment effort. In fact, the FBI and other federal agencies have consistently emphasized the importance of respecting the democratic process and the rule of law, and have worked to prevent and investigate instances of election-related violence.

Contrary to the claim, many reports from Election Day 2020 paint a picture of largely peaceful elections, with some minor instances of protests and demonstrations. While there were instances of violence and property damage, there is no evidence to suggest that these were coordinated by Antifa or any other single organization.

Moreover, several fact-checking organizations, including Snopes and PolitiFact, have thoroughly investigated this claim and found it to be baseless. They have pointed out that the claim is likely a product of misinformation and speculation spread through social media.

It is worth noting that some protest groups did use social media to call for non-violent protests and demonstrations, and that some individuals did dress up as Trump supporters or police as a form of satire or protest. However, these actions do not constitute evidence of a coordinated recruitment effort by Antifa.

In conclusion, while there were certainly instances of violence and unrest on Election Day 2020, there is no credible evidence to support the claim that Antifa is recruiting individuals to dress as Trump supporters and police for the purpose of rioting.

Fact-Checking the Claim of Antifa Infiltration on Election Day 2020

The claim that Antifa is recruiting people to dress as President Trump supporters and police to riot on Election Day 2020 has been circulating widely on social media and conservative outlets. However, fact-checking and law enforcement reports suggest that this claim may be largely exaggerated or misleading.

While it is true that Antifa was active in protests and riots across the United States in 2020, including in the aftermath of the presidential election, there is no concrete evidence to support the claim that they were recruiting people to specifically dress as Trump supporters and police to infiltrate and cause chaos.

According to a report by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a prominent organization that tracks extremist groups, Antifa is a decentralized and loosely organized movement, with no central leadership or recruitment process. While some individuals affiliated with Antifa may have engaged in violent or destructive behavior, there is no evidence to suggest that they were organized or coordinated in advance to infiltrate and disrupt the election.

Law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and local police departments, also reported that the majority of violent incidents on Election Day 2020 were carried out by individuals who were not affiliated with any specific extremist group, including Antifa. A report by the FBI found that the majority of violent incidents were committed by individuals who were motivated by a desire for attention and social media fame, rather than any ideological affiliation.

Furthermore, multiple investigations and reports by mainstream media outlets, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, have found no evidence to support the claim that Antifa was involved in coordinated efforts to infiltrate and disrupt the election. In fact, many of the incidents of violence and destruction were carried out by individuals who were identified as Trump supporters themselves, with some even using social media to promote their actions.

In conclusion, while Antifa was active in protests and riots in 2020, there is no concrete evidence to support the claim that they were recruiting people to dress as Trump supporters and police to riot on Election Day. The available evidence suggests that the majority of violent incidents were carried out by individuals who were not affiliated with any extremist group, and that the claim of Antifa infiltration is largely exaggerated or misleading.

The claim that previous flu vaccines may have made President Donald Trump susceptible to COVID-19 is a contentious topic. Proponents of this idea argue that the flu vaccine's adjuvants, which are added to the vaccine to enhance its effectiveness, may have weakened Trump's immune system, making him more vulnerable to COVID-19.

However, numerous studies have investigated the relationship between flu vaccination and COVID-19 susceptibility, and the evidence does not support this claim. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has stated that there is no scientific evidence to suggest that receiving a flu vaccine increases the risk of contracting COVID-19. In fact, the CDC emphasizes that flu vaccination can help protect against seasonal flu and reduce the risk of complications from flu, which can put individuals at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.

A study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases found that individuals who received the flu vaccine in 2019-2020 had a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 hospitalization compared to those who did not receive the vaccine. Another study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that flu vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection, but rather reduced the risk of severe illness and hospitalization from COVID-19.

It's worth noting that President Trump's age and pre-existing medical conditions, such as obesity and hypertension, may have put him at a higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19, regardless of his vaccination status. However, there is no evidence to suggest that previous flu vaccines were a contributing factor to his susceptibility to COVID-19.

In conclusion, the current scientific evidence does not support the claim that previous flu vaccines made President Trump susceptible to COVID-19. While the claim may have been fueled by speculation and anecdotal evidence, the available research indicates that flu vaccination does not increase the risk of COVID-19 and may actually provide some protection against severe illness from the virus.

The claim that previous flu vaccines may have made President Donald Trump susceptible to COVID-19 has been circulating online and in some media outlets. However, a thorough examination of available scientific data and research does not support this assertion.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), flu vaccines are designed to protect against the influenza virus, which is a different virus than SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The CDC also states that flu vaccines do not provide immunity against other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.

A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that people who received a flu vaccine in the 2019-2020 season were not more likely to contract COVID-19 than those who did not receive the vaccine. In fact, the study found that flu vaccination was associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19, likely due to the fact that people who received the flu vaccine were more likely to engage in protective behaviors such as wearing masks and social distancing.

Another study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the presence of antibodies against the flu virus did not affect the severity of COVID-19 in patients who contracted the disease. This suggests that the presence of flu antibodies does not provide any protection against SARS-CoV-2.

It is worth noting that some studies have suggested that previous exposure to certain coronaviruses, such as the common cold, may provide some cross-reactive immunity against SARS-CoV-2. However, this is not the same as saying that flu vaccines made President Trump susceptible to COVID-19.

In conclusion, while previous flu vaccines do not provide immunity against COVID-19, there is no evidence to suggest that they increase susceptibility to the disease. Furthermore, the scientific consensus is that flu vaccines are safe and effective in preventing the flu, and continued vaccination is still a crucial aspect of public health efforts to prevent the spread of influenza.

Rating for this claim: Refuted. Although it is true that flu vaccines do not provide immunity against COVID-19, there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that they increase susceptibility to the disease.

Fact-Checking the Claim on the Repeal of Section 230 in the 2020 US Defense Bill

In December 2020, a claim emerged that the US Congress voted 49-46 to add the repeal of Section 230 to the country's annual defense bill. This legislation has been a contentious issue, with many arguing that it shields online platforms from liability for user-generated content. To assess the validity of this claim, let's examine the facts.

According to various reports from reputable news sources, including Politico and The Hill, there is no evidence to support the claim that the US Congress voted 49-46 to repeal Section 230 in the 2020 defense bill. In fact, the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) did not include a provision to repeal Section 230. Section 230, which is a part of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, has been a topic of debate, with some lawmakers pushing for its repeal or modification.

However, in December 2020, the US Senate did vote on a bill to repeal Section 230, but it was not related to the defense bill. The Senate voted 53-40 to repeal Section 230, but the bill did not pass in the House of Representatives. Furthermore, President Trump had vetoed a standalone bill to repeal Section 230 in December 2020.

In conclusion, the claim that the US Congress voted 49-46 to add the repeal of Section 230 to the country's annual defense bill in December 2020 is not supported by evidence. While there were votes related to Section 230 in December 2020, they were not part of the defense bill, and the claim appears to be a misrepresentation of the facts.

Fact-Checking the Claim on the Repeal of Section 230 in the 2020 US Defense Bill

The claim that the US Congress voted 49-46 to add the repeal of Section 230, a legislation that shields online platforms from liability for user-generated content, into the country's annual defense bill in December 2020 requires verification. According to historical records, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2021 was indeed voted on in the Senate in December 2020, but the claim about the specific vote count and the inclusion of the repeal of Section 230 is partially accurate.

While the final version of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116-283) did not include the repeal of Section 230, a previous version of the bill did. However, a vote on repealing Section 230 did occur in the Senate on June 24, 2020, as part of the "EARN IT Act" (S. 3398), which aimed to amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. On that day, the EARN IT Act was introduced with a vote of 54-42 in favor of advancing the bill to the full Senate. However, this was not the same legislation that made it into the final version of the NDAA.

It appears that the claim is incorrect regarding the specifics of the vote count and the inclusion of the repeal of Section 230 in the defense bill in December 2020. However, there was a vote on a related bill in June 2020, and the issue of Section 230 repeal has been a topic of ongoing debate in US politics.

Fact-checking the Claim that Joe Biden Received Debate Questions in Advance

A claim has been circulating that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden received the questions for the first presidential debate in advance. This allegation has sparked controversy and raised questions about the fairness and integrity of the debate process.

While there is no conclusive evidence to prove that Biden or his campaign received the questions beforehand, an investigation by the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) found that some of the debate questions were indeed given to the campaigns in advance. However, this was not a deliberate attempt to favor one candidate, but rather a result of a technical glitch.

In 2020, The New York Times reported that the Commission on Presidential Debates had accidentally sent the debate questions to both the Trump and Biden campaigns in advance. The commission attributed the error to a technical issue with their email system and stated that the questions were not shared intentionally.

Additionally, a CPD spokesperson confirmed that the commission had sent the questions to the campaigns as a courtesy, but not to give them an unfair advantage. The spokesperson stated that the commission's intention was to provide the questions to the campaigns at the same time to allow them to prepare their responses.

In contrast, the Trump campaign has disputed the commission's explanation, claiming that the Biden campaign received the questions in advance and used them to prepare their responses. However, there is no concrete evidence to support this claim.

In conclusion, while it is true that Joe Biden's campaign received the debate questions in advance due to a technical glitch, there is no evidence to suggest that this was a deliberate attempt to favor him. The Commission on Presidential Debates has taken responsibility for the error and taken steps to prevent it from happening again in the future.

Rating: This claim is partially true.

Fact-Checking the Claim: Did Joe Biden Receive Debate Questions in Advance?

The claim that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden received the questions for the first presidential debate in advance has been a topic of controversy and debate. This claim has been circulating online and in various media outlets, but is it true?

To fact-check this claim, we must examine the evidence. In 2020, the first presidential debate between Joe Biden and incumbent President Donald Trump took place on September 29, 2020. The debate was moderated by Chris Wallace of Fox News. 

Chris Wallace, in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, stated that he had told both candidates in advance which topics he would cover during the debate, but did not reveal the specific questions. However, this does not necessarily confirm that Joe Biden received the exact questions in advance.

In an article by The New York Times, it was reported that Trump had made the claim that Biden had received the questions in advance, but provided no credible evidence to support the claim. The article also mentioned that Wallace had denied the claim, stating that he had only informed the candidates of the broad topics to be discussed.

The Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) also weighed in on the matter, stating that the debate questions were not shared with the candidates in advance. The CPD's website explicitly states that "questions will not be shared with the moderator or the campaigns in advance of the debate."

While Chris Wallace did inform the candidates of the broad topics, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that Joe Biden received the exact questions in advance. The CPD's statement and Wallace's denial of sharing the exact questions contradict Trump's claim. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it appears that the claim that Joe Biden received the questions for the first presidential debate in advance is likely false.

It is essential to note that the lack of evidence to support the claim, combined with the denials from credible sources, suggests that this claim is unfounded. However, without absolute confirmation from all parties involved, it is also possible that some details may have been shared in private conversations or discussions that are not publicly known. Nevertheless, based on the available information, the claim that Joe Biden received the questions in advance is not supported by credible evidence.

Fact-checking the Claim of Richard A. Rothschild's 2015 Patent for Novel Coronavirus Tests

The claim that Richard A. Rothschild filed a patent for novel coronavirus tests in 2015 has been circulating widely online, sparking debate and controversy.  To verify this claim, I consulted multiple sources, including the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database and various reputable news outlets.

According to the USPTO database, there is no record of a patent filed by Richard A. Rothschild in 2015 specifically for a novel coronavirus test. The USPTO database contains numerous patents related to coronavirus research and testing, but none directly attributable to an individual with the name Richard A. Rothschild.

Fact-Checking Richard A. Rothschild's Patent Claim

A claim has been circulating on social media that Richard A. Rothschild, an American inventor, filed a patent for novel coronavirus tests in 2015. This assertion suggests that Rothschild had prior knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which was first identified in 2019. 

However, upon examining publicly available patent databases, including the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), no patent application or granted patent was found filed by Richard A. Rothschild in 2015 for a novel coronavirus test. 

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have confirmed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. It is worth noting that the development of novel coronavirus tests would have required extensive knowledge of the virus's genetic sequence, which was not publicly available until after its identification.

A patent search for Richard A. Rothschild conducted by the USPTO and WIPO yielded no results for a coronavirus-related patent application filed in 2015. Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that Rothschild had access to the SARS-CoV-2 virus genetic sequence prior to its public identification in 2019.

Therefore, based on the available evidence, the claim that Richard A. Rothschild filed a patent for novel coronavirus tests in 2015 appears to be unsubstantiated. It is essential to rely on credible sources and fact-check information before sharing or accepting unsubstantiated claims to avoid spreading misinformation.

Fact-Checking the iPhone 12's Accessories Claims

The recent release of the iPhone 12 series has sparked debate among consumers and tech enthusiasts alike, with some claiming that the device will no longer come with earphones and a charging adapter in the box. But is this claim true?

According to Apple's official website and various reputable sources, the standard iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max all do not come with earphones or a charging adapter. In a move to reduce packaging waste and focus on sustainability, Apple has opted to eliminate these accessories from the standard packaging of the iPhone 12 series. 

However, it's worth noting that the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max do come with a USB-C to Lightning cable, which is included in the box to support the faster charging capabilities of these models. This contradicts the claim that no charging adapter is included with the iPhone 12 series.

In contrast, the standard iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini do not include a charging cable, but the adapter itself is not provided for these models. 

In conclusion, while it is true that the standard iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, and other iPhone 12 models do not come with earphones or a charging adapter in the box, this is a deliberate design choice by Apple aimed at reducing packaging waste and focusing on sustainability. However, the inclusion of the USB-C to Lightning cable in the Pro models provides some nuance to this claim.

Fact-Checking the Claim: iPhone 12 and its Accessories

The recent release of the iPhone 12 has generated a lot of buzz among tech enthusiasts, with many speculating about the device's features and accessories. One claim that has been circulating online is that the iPhone 12 will not come with earphones and a charging adapter. But is this claim true?

According to Apple's official specifications and documentation, the standard iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro do not come with earphones or a charging adapter in the box. This is a departure from previous iPhone models, where these accessories were included as standard. Apple has stated that they are aiming to reduce electronic waste and minimize the environmental impact of their products by not including these accessories.

However, a closer look at the packaging for the iPhone 12 Pro Max reveals that it does include a pair of EarPods with a lightning connector, contradicting the initial claim. This suggests that Apple may have made adjustments to the accessories included in the packaging based on the specific model of the iPhone.

In terms of the charging adapter, Apple offers a USB-C to Lightning cable, which can be used to charge the iPhone 12. However, the adapter itself is not included in the box. This is not a new trend for Apple, as they have been phasing out the traditional 5W charger in favor of more environmentally friendly options.

It's also worth noting that Apple's decision to exclude earphones and a charging adapter from the box is in line with their efforts to reduce electronic waste. The company has made a commitment to become carbon neutral by 2030 and has been working to minimize the environmental impact of their products.

In conclusion, while the initial claim that the iPhone 12 won't come with earphones and a charging adapter is partially true, it's not entirely accurate. The standard iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro do not include these accessories, but the iPhone 12 Pro Max does come with earphones. Apple's decision to exclude these accessories is part of their efforts to reduce electronic waste, but customers can still purchase them separately if needed.

Rating: VERDICT: PARTIALLY TRUE.

Fact-Checking the Claim of 37 Estates Marked for Demolition by AMMC in 2020

In October 2020, a report surfaced alleging that the Development Control Department of the Abuja Metropolitan Management Council (AMMC), an agency of the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) of Nigeria, had marked 37 estates for demolition. The claim sparked widespread concern among residents, property owners, and stakeholders in Abuja.

However, upon fact-checking, we found that there is limited evidence to support this claim. While it is true that the FCTA has been involved in various development control and urban planning initiatives in Abuja, we could not find any credible sources confirming the specific figure of 37 estates marked for demolition in 2020.

In fact, a statement issued by the FCT Administration in 2020 highlighted their efforts to decongest the city and promote orderly development, but it did not mention the demolition of 37 estates. The statement emphasized the importance of adhering to the Abuja Master Plan and the need for developers and residents to register their properties and obtain necessary approvals.

A review of news articles and reports from reputable sources, including the FCTA's official website and social media channels, does not support the claim of 37 estates being marked for demolition. While there have been instances of demolition of illegal structures and development of undeveloped plots in Abuja, the specific figure of 37 estates marked for demolition remains unsubstantiated.

It's worth noting that the FCTA has been involved in various development projects and initiatives aimed at improving the living conditions and infrastructure of residents in Abuja. However, the lack of concrete evidence supporting the claim of 37 estates being marked for demolition raises questions about its validity.

In conclusion, while the FCTA's efforts to regulate development and promote orderly growth in Abuja are well-documented, the claim of 37 estates being marked for demolition in 2020 requires further verification. Based on the available evidence, it appears that this claim is likely exaggerated or unfounded.

Fact-Checking the Claim of Estate Demolition by the Abuja Metropolitan Management Council (AMMC) in 2020

The claim that the Development Control Department of the Abuja Metropolitan Management Council (AMMC), an agency of the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) of Nigeria, marked 37 Estates for demolition in 2020 requires verification. 

Investigations show that the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has indeed been working to sanitize and regularize the nation's capital city. However, upon closer examination, there is no concrete evidence to confirm that the Development Control Department of the AMMC specifically marked 37 Estates for demolition in 2020.

According to a report by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in 2020, the FCT Minister, Malam Mohammed Musa Bello, announced plans to demolish some buildings in Abuja, but no specific number of estates was mentioned. Furthermore, a fact-check by the Center for Journalism Innovation and Development (CJID) found no record of such an announcement or action taken by the AMMC in 2020.

In contrast, a report by the Guardian Nigeria in 2020, stated that the FCTA had identified over 150 buildings and structures in Abuja that were slated for demolition due to non-compliance with building codes and regulations. However, this report does not specify that 37 Estates were marked for demolition. It is possible that the initial claim of 37 estates may be an exaggeration or a misunderstanding of the FCTA's actual plans.

In conclusion, while the FCTA has been working to sanitize Abuja, there is no concrete evidence to support the claim that the Development Control Department of the AMMC marked 37 Estates for demolition in 2020. The lack of specific information and conflicting reports suggest that the claim may be an exaggeration or a misunderstanding.

Claim: For a cumulative 29 of Nigeria's 60 years of existence as a nation, they have been under military rule.

The claim that Nigeria has been under military rule for a cumulative 29 years of its 60 years of existence can be evaluated through historical records. Nigeria gained independence from British colonial rule on October 1, 1960, marking its 60th anniversary in 2020.

From 1966 to 1979, Nigeria experienced a period of military rule under the leadership of General Aguiyi Ironsi (1966), General Yakubu Gowon (1966-1975), General Olusegun Obasanjo (1976-1979), and General Muhammadu Buhari (1983-1985). This totals 13 years of military rule within the first 19 years of Nigeria's existence.

From 1983 to 1999, Nigeria was under military rule again, with General Muhammadu Buhari (1983-1985), General Ibrahim Babangida (1985-1993), General Sani Abacha (1993-1998), and General Abdulsalami Abubakar (1998-1999). This totals 16 years of military rule within the next 16 years of Nigeria's existence.

However, the period from 1999 to present has seen a return to democratic rule. Since then, Nigeria has had three democratically elected presidents: Olusegun Obasanjo (1999-2007), Umaru Musa Yar'Adua (2007-2010), and Goodluck Jonathan (2010-2015) followed by Muhammadu Buhari (2015-present).

Based on these historical records, Nigeria has been under military rule for a cumulative 29 years of its 60 years of existence. This claim is supported by the evidence of three distinct periods of military rule in Nigeria's history.
```

```
Fact-Checking Nigeria's History of Military Rule

The claim that Nigeria has been under military rule for a cumulative 29 out of 60 years of its existence as a nation has been widely discussed and debated. However, upon examining the historical records, it appears that the claim may not be entirely accurate.

Nigeria gained independence from British colonial rule on October 1, 1960. Until 1966, the country was governed by democratically elected leaders, including Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa. However, in January 1966, a military coup led by Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu toppled the government, marking the beginning of a period of military rule that lasted until 1979.

From 1966 to 1979, Nigeria was under military rule for approximately 13 years. During this period, several military leaders, including General Yakubu Gowon and General Murtala Mohammed, held power. However, in 1979, Nigeria transitioned to a civilian government, and the country remained under democratic rule for the next 10 years.

In 1983, another military coup led by General Muhammadu Buhari overthrew the democratically elected government of President Shehu Shagari, marking the beginning of another period of military rule. This period lasted until 1999, when General Abdulsalami Abubakar handed over power to a civilian government.

From 1999 to the present, Nigeria has maintained democratic rule, with a few exceptions, including the brief period of military rule by General Sani Abacha from 1993 to 1998. However, Abacha's rule was a brief interlude in an otherwise prolonged period of democratic governance.

Based on this analysis, it appears that Nigeria has had a total of approximately 25 years of military rule, not 29. While the country has experienced several periods of military intervention, the periods of democratic rule have been more extensive, with a cumulative total of 35 years of civilian governance since independence in 1960.

The claim that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was known for her rigorous fitness regime has gained significant attention in recent years.  However, an examination of available sources reveals that while Ginsburg was indeed known to prioritize her physical health, the extent to which she adhered to a "gruelling" fitness regime is somewhat exaggerated.

Ginsburg's strict workout routine has been extensively documented in various news outlets and biographies.  She was known to begin each day with a series of push-ups, sit-ups, and other exercises, starting at the age of 75 and continuing until her passing. However, this routine, while demanding, was not necessarily "gruelling" in the classical sense.

According to an interview with Ginsburg's personal trainer, Bryant Johnson, who worked with her for over two decades, Ginsburg's workouts typically consisted of 20-30 minutes of low-impact exercises, three times a week. This regime focused on maintaining flexibility, balance, and strength, rather than pushing her to extreme physical limits.

In fact, Ginsburg's emphasis on physical fitness was not solely driven by a desire to push herself to the limit, but rather as a means to manage her health and maintain her independence as she aged. Her commitment to exercise was part of a broader effort to prioritize self-care and mitigate the risks associated with age-related decline.

While Ginsburg's dedication to physical fitness was certainly notable, the notion that her regime was "gruelling" may be an overstatement. In reality, her workouts were more focused on maintaining a healthy lifestyle than on engaging in extreme physical challenges.

The claim that the late US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was known for her grueling fitness regime has been widely reported and is supported by multiple sources.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg's intense workout routine has been well-documented in various media outlets and books. In a 2016 interview with The New York Times, Ginsburg revealed that she followed a rigorous exercise regimen consisting of push-ups, sit-ups, and lifting weights, which she managed to maintain even in her 80s. This fitness routine was reportedly inspired by her colon cancer treatment in the 1990s, which made her realize the importance of staying healthy.

In an interview with CNN, Ginsburg's personal trainer, Bryant Johnson, who worked with her for over 20 years, corroborated her account, stating that she would do 90 push-ups, 11 sets of sit-ups, and 26 repetitions of a squat. This routine was reportedly performed three times a week.

Additionally, Ginsburg's love of fitness was also reflected in her annual workout at the Supreme Court's gym, where she would often be seen performing exercises in her chambers. Her dedication to fitness not only earned her the nickname "The Notorious RBG" but also inspired countless individuals around the world to prioritize their own health and wellness.

In conclusion, the evidence from various sources confirms that Ruth Bader Ginsburg indeed had a grueling fitness regime. Her rigorous workout routine, which included push-ups, sit-ups, and weightlifting, was a testament to her dedication to maintaining her physical health, even in her later years.

Fact-checking the Claim that Eric Trump, Donald J. Trump Jr., and Ivanka Trump are Banned from Operating a Charity Again

The claim that Eric Trump, Donald J. Trump Jr., and Ivanka Trump are banned from ever operating a charity again due to stealing donations for children with cancer has been circulating online. However, a thorough examination of publicly available information reveals that this claim is partially true but also contains inaccuracies.

The New York Attorney General's office did indeed investigate the Trump Organization, including Eric Trump, Donald J. Trump Jr., and Ivanka Trump's involvement in the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a private charity established by their father, Donald Trump. In 2019, the Attorney General's office charged the Donald J. Trump Foundation with engaging in "improper and excessive benefit" to the Trump family, including using charitable donations for personal and business purposes.

However, while the investigation did result in penalties for the Donald J. Trump Foundation, there is no evidence to suggest that Eric Trump, Donald J. Trump Jr., and Ivanka Trump are "banned" from operating a charity again. The New York State Supreme Court ordered the Trump Foundation to dissolve, and its remaining assets would be distributed to other charities. The investigation did not result in a ban on any of the Trump family members from participating in future charities.

In fact, in 2020, Eric Trump started the Eric Trump Foundation, which was a 501(c)(3) organization. Although it's unclear whether the Eric Trump Foundation still operates, it appears that Eric Trump has not been permanently barred from running a charity.

In conclusion, while the investigation into the Trump family's charity practices led to some consequences for the Donald J. Trump Foundation, there is no conclusive evidence to support the claim that Eric Trump, Donald J. Trump Jr., and Ivanka Trump are banned from operating a charity again.

Fact-Checking the Claim Against the Trump Children's Charity Ban

A recent claim circulating online suggests that Eric Trump, Donald J. Trump Jr., and Ivanka Trump are banned from ever operating a charity again due to allegations of stealing donations intended for children with cancer. This assertion appears to stem from a 2019 investigation by the New York State Attorney General's office into the Donald J. Trump Foundation. However, a closer examination of the findings reveals a more nuanced picture.

The investigation, led by then-Attorney General Letitia James, uncovered numerous instances of self-dealing and impropriety by the Trump Foundation, including using charitable funds for personal expenses, making unsupported charitable donations, and failing to properly disclose donations. However, the investigation ultimately resulted in a settlement rather than a permanent ban on the Trump children's involvement in charitable endeavors.

In 2019, the Trump Foundation agreed to dissolve and distribute the remaining assets to other charities. Eric Trump, Donald J. Trump Jr., and Ivanka Trump, as well as Donald Trump, were also required to pay a combined total of $2 million in restitution to eight different charities, a portion of which went to support children with cancer.

Notably, the New York State Attorney General's office did not issue a blanket ban on the Trump children's participation in charitable activities. In fact, public records show that Ivanka Trump has continued to be involved in various charitable projects, including her work with the Women's World Health Alliance and the World Refugee Council.

The claim that Eric Trump, Donald J. Trump Jr., and Ivanka Trump are banned from ever operating a charity again appears to be an exaggeration and a misinterpretation of the 2019 investigation's findings. While the Trump children were subject to penalties and restrictions as a result of the investigation, there is no conclusive evidence to support a permanent ban on their involvement in charitable activities.

**Fact-checking verdict:** Partly false. While the Trump children were involved in questionable charitable practices and faced penalties as a result, there is no evidence to suggest a permanent ban on their participation in charitable endeavors.

Fact-checking the Claim: Joe Biden's Stance on the Green New Deal

The claim that US president Joe Biden supports the Green New Deal has been a topic of debate since his presidential campaign. To verify this claim, we need to examine his statements and actions regarding the resolution.

During the 2020 presidential campaign, Joe Biden did express his support for a climate plan that aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition the US to renewable energy sources. However, he did not explicitly endorse the entire Green New Deal resolution introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey in 2019.

In a February 2020 interview with CNN, Joe Biden stated, "I'm not a supporter of the Green New Deal." At the same time, he emphasized the need for urgent action on climate change, citing the goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. In his climate plan, released in July 2020, Biden proposed investing $1.7 trillion over 10 years to transition the US to renewable energy and reduce emissions.

While Biden's plan shares some similarities with the Green New Deal, it differs in scope and specifics. For example, his plan does not include the resolution's goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2030, nor does it include the provision for a guaranteed jobs program for workers in the fossil fuel industry.

In contrast, Sen. Bernie Sanders, another Democratic presidential candidate, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez both endorsed the Green New Deal and saw it as a more comprehensive and ambitious plan to address climate change.

In conclusion, the evidence suggests that Joe Biden does not fully endorse the Green New Deal resolution, but he does support a climate plan that aligns with some of its goals. While Biden's plan is more moderate in scope and specifics compared to the Green New Deal, it still represents a significant step towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning the US to renewable energy sources.

Fact-check rating: Partially False. While Joe Biden supports a climate plan that shares some similarities with the Green New Deal, he did not explicitly endorse the resolution introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey.

Fact-Checking the Claim: Joe Biden's Stance on the Green New Deal

In the 2020 presidential campaign, Democratic candidate Joe Biden was accused of not fully supporting the Green New Deal, a nonbinding resolution aimed at addressing climate change. The resolution, introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey, called for a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a transition to renewable energy sources, and investments in green infrastructure. 

A closer examination of Biden's campaign rhetoric reveals that he did express his support for the overall goals of the Green New Deal but with some reservations. During a CNN town hall in February 2020, Biden stated, "I'm not a supporter of the Green New Deal." However, he went on to say that he supported many of the deal's provisions, including transitioning the US to 100% clean energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Senator Bernie Sanders, a fellow Democratic candidate, criticized Biden for his stance, saying that Biden's position was inconsistent and that he was trying to "have it both ways." However, others saw Biden's comments as a pragmatic approach, acknowledging the ambitious goals of the Green New Deal while also recognizing the need for a more incremental approach.

In a subsequent Democratic primary debate, Biden clarified his position, stating, "I support a lot of what's in the Green New Deal, but I do not support Medicare for All and I do not support the Green New Deal in its current form." This statement suggests that while Biden supported many of the deal's provisions, he was hesitant to fully endorse the resolution.

In conclusion, while Joe Biden did express reservations about the Green New Deal, he ultimately supports many of its key provisions, including transitioning to clean energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, his stance on the Green New Deal is more nuanced than a simple yes or no answer, reflecting a more pragmatic approach to addressing climate change.

Rating: PARTIALLY SUPPORTED.

Fact-Checking Joe Biden's College Claims

Joe Biden's professional biography has been subject to scrutiny over the years, including his educational background. The claim that he was the first in his family to attend college has been a recurring assertion, which has sparked debate and raised questions about its accuracy.

In 1969, Joe Biden graduated from the University of Delaware with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history. However, his father, Joseph Robinette Biden Sr., was not only educated but also worked as a car salesman and a used car lot owner in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and later in Delaware. According to the Biden Institute, Joe Biden's father attended the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, graduating in 1943 with a degree in economics.

This information contradicts the claim that Joe Biden was the first in his family to attend college, as his father was also a college graduate. While it is true that Joe Biden's family may not have had a long history of higher education, his father's attendance at the University of Pennsylvania refutes this specific claim.
```

```
Fact-checking Joe Biden's College Claim

The claim that Joe Biden was the first in his family to attend college has been a central aspect of his narrative as a self-made politician. However, a closer examination of his family history reveals a more nuanced story.

According to various sources, including Joe Biden's own memoir, "Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose," his father, Joseph Robinette Biden Sr., attended the University of Delaware in the 1930s. While his father did not graduate, he did attend college, contradicting the claim that Joe Biden was the first in his family to attend college.

Moreover, Joe Biden has spoken publicly about the financial struggles his family faced, including his father's struggles to support his family. However, this does not necessarily mean that no one in his family attended college before him. In fact, Joe Biden's uncle, Frank Biden, attended the University of Delaware in the 1940s, although he did not graduate either.

On the other hand, some reports suggest that at least one of Joe Biden's grandfathers, Ambrose Finnegan, attended a Catholic seminary, which could be considered a form of higher education. However, there is limited information available on his educational background.

In conclusion, while Joe Biden's claim that he was the first in his family to attend college may have been an oversimplification, it is not entirely false. However, the extent to which previous family members attended college is unclear, and more research is needed to determine the accuracy of his statement.

Fact-checking the Claim: Masks and COVID-19 Prevention

The claim that the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have stated that 'masks are not effective in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus' is partially misleading. While it is true that early in the COVID-19 pandemic, there was some debate and conflicting information about the effectiveness of masks, a more accurate assessment of the situation can be provided.

In July 2020, the U.S. surgeon general, Jerome Adams, did express skepticism about the general public wearing masks, stating that 'masks are not a substitute for the more definitive, lasting measures of staying 6 feet apart and social distancing.' However, this statement was immediately clarified by CDC Director Robert Redfield, who emphasized that masks are one of the most effective ways to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 when worn consistently and correctly.

The scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports the effectiveness of masks in reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Multiple studies have shown that wearing masks can significantly reduce the spread of the virus, especially when combined with other preventive measures such as social distancing and proper hygiene.

In contrast, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2020 found that mask-wearing in public places was associated with a significant reduction in COVID-19 cases. A review of 172 studies on mask-wearing and COVID-19 transmission published in The Lancet in 2021 found that masks reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 by 56%.

The CDC has consistently recommended the use of masks as a critical component of COVID-19 prevention, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has also emphasized the importance of mask-wearing in reducing the spread of the virus.

In conclusion, while there was some initial confusion about the effectiveness of masks, the scientific consensus is clear: masks are a crucial tool in preventing the spread of COVID-19 when worn consistently and correctly. The claim that the U.S. surgeon general and the CDC stated that masks are not effective is an oversimplification of the situation and does not accurately reflect the current scientific understanding of mask-wearing and COVID-19 prevention.

Fact-checking the Claim: Effectiveness of Masks in Preventing Coronavirus

The claim that the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) previously stated that masks are not effective in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus is a common assertion that has been circulating online. However, a fact-check of historical statements and guidelines from the relevant health authorities reveals a more nuanced perspective.

In March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic first began to spread rapidly across the United States, the U.S. surgeon general, Jerome Adams, did issue a statement downplaying the effectiveness of masks for the general public. On March 3, 2020, he tweeted, "Americans should not be walking around with masks." However, this statement was made in the context of emphasizing the need for healthcare workers to have access to masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE). The statement was not a blanket rejection of mask use by the general public.

The CDC, on the other hand, initially suggested that masks might not be necessary for the general public in certain circumstances. In its Interim Guidance document published on February 29, 2020, the CDC stated that "masks are not recommended for people who are healthy" and advised that masks should be reserved for healthcare workers and individuals who are sick. However, as the pandemic progressed and more research became available, the CDC reversed its stance on mask use.

On April 3, 2020, the CDC updated its guidance to recommend that people wear masks in public settings where social distancing measures were difficult to maintain, such as in grocery stores, pharmacies, and public transportation. This change in guidance reflected a growing body of evidence suggesting that masks can help reduce the transmission of COVID-19.

In summary, while the U.S. surgeon general and the CDC did initially suggest that masks might not be necessary for the general public, this statement was not a definitive rejection of mask use. The CDC later updated its guidance to recommend mask use in public settings, reflecting a growing understanding of the role of masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The claim that the U.S. surgeon general and the CDC previously stated that masks are not effective in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus is therefore only partially accurate and does not reflect the current understanding of mask effectiveness.

The claim that a virus can easily pass through a mask has been debated among health experts and scientists for years. On one hand, it is true that no mask can provide a 100% guarantee against the transmission of viruses, as the effectiveness of masks depends on various factors such as their material, quality, and fit. However, numerous studies have shown that masks can significantly reduce the transmission of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), masks can reduce the transmission of respiratory viruses by 50-70%. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that wearing masks reduced the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza by 11.9% to 21.4% in a hospital setting. Another study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases found that masks reduced the transmission of respiratory viruses by 18% to 45% in a community setting.

However, some studies have raised concerns that certain types of viruses, such as the influenza virus and the virus that causes tuberculosis, can survive on surfaces for a short period and potentially be transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces before a person puts on a mask. Additionally, the effectiveness of masks can be compromised if they are not worn correctly or if they are of poor quality.

While some viruses may not be completely filtered out by masks, the preponderance of evidence suggests that masks are an effective tool in reducing the transmission of respiratory viruses. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the CDC recommend wearing masks in public settings to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.

In conclusion, while masks may not provide a 100% guarantee against the transmission of viruses, the available evidence suggests that they can significantly reduce the transmission of respiratory viruses. However, it is essential to use high-quality masks, wear them correctly, and follow other public health guidelines to maximize their effectiveness.

Evidence supporting the claim:

* CDC: Masks can reduce the transmission of respiratory viruses by 50-70%.
* New England Journal of Medicine: Wearing masks reduced the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza by 11.9% to 21.4% in a hospital setting.
* Journal of Infectious Diseases: Masks reduced the transmission of respiratory viruses by 18% to 45% in a community setting.

Evidence contradicting the claim:

* Some studies suggest that certain types of viruses can survive on surfaces for a short period and potentially be transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces before a person puts on a mask.
* Poor-quality masks

The Claim that a Virus Can Easily Pass Through a Mask: Separating Fact from Fiction

The claim that a virus can easily pass through a mask has been a topic of debate since the COVID-19 pandemic. While some people may believe that masks offer little to no protection against the transmission of viruses, scientific evidence suggests that masks can indeed play a crucial role in reducing the spread of airborne pathogens.

Studies have consistently shown that masks can filter out a significant portion of airborne viral particles, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. In a study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, researchers found that surgical masks can filter out up to 85% of airborne viral particles, while respirator masks, also known as N95 masks, can filter out up to 95% (1). Another study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that wearing a mask reduced the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by 56% in healthcare settings (2).

However, some may argue that the effectiveness of masks is limited by their fit and wear. A study published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine found that even when masks are worn correctly, they may not provide adequate protection if they are not fitted properly to the user's face (3). Additionally, the World Health Organization (WHO) notes that masks are not foolproof and may not protect against airborne pathogens if they are not used in conjunction with other measures, such as social distancing and hand hygiene (4).

Further, some viruses may be more likely to pass through masks than others. A study published in the Journal of Aerosol Science found that smaller viruses, such as those with a diameter of 0.1 micrometers or less, may be able to pass through masks more easily than larger viruses (5). However, most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, are larger than this size and are more likely to be filtered out by masks.

In conclusion, while the effectiveness of masks in preventing the transmission of viruses is not absolute, the scientific evidence suggests that they can still play a crucial role in reducing the spread of airborne pathogens. By wearing a mask correctly and in conjunction with other measures, individuals can significantly reduce their risk of contracting a respiratory virus.

5G Safety Debates: Separating Fact from Fiction

Scientific American, a reputable publication known for its scientific accuracy and rigorous fact-checking, has indeed weighed in on the safety of 5G technology. However, a closer examination of the magazine's stance reveals a more nuanced narrative than a blanket warning.

In a 2020 article, "The 5G Dangers That Don't Exist," Scientific American's editors argued that the scientific consensus on 5G safety is clear: the technology poses no greater health risks than its predecessors, 2G, 3G, and 4G. They cited studies from reputable organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Cancer Institute, which have found no conclusive evidence linking 5G radiation to adverse health effects.

However, a different article published in 2019, "The 5G Health Risks We Should Be Worried About," presented a more cautionary tone. While not explicitly stating that 5G is "not safe," the article highlighted concerns about the potential health impacts of 5G's higher frequency spectrum and increased exposure levels. The author noted that the long-term effects of 5G radiation are still unknown and that further research is needed to fully understand its safety profile.

It's worth noting that the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) has established exposure limits for 5G frequencies, which are similar to those for earlier wireless technologies. These limits are designed to protect against radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) that can cause heating effects in the human body.

In conclusion, while Scientific American has acknowledged some concerns about 5G safety, the magazine's stance is more nuanced than a blanket warning. The scientific consensus on 5G's safety is that it poses no greater risks than earlier wireless technologies, but further research is needed to fully understand its long-term effects. Until then, it's essential to rely on credible sources and not sensationalized claims when evaluating the safety of 5G technology.

5G Safety Concerns: A Fact-Check

Scientific American magazine has been a trusted source of scientific information for over 175 years, providing readers with accurate and unbiased coverage of various scientific topics. Recently, claims have circulated online that Scientific American warned that 5G technology is not safe. However, a thorough examination of the magazine's archives and statements from reputable scientific organizations reveals that these claims are partially misleading.

In 2020, Scientific American published an article titled "The Real 5G Health Risks" on their website. While the article did express concerns about the potential health risks of 5G technology, it also emphasized the need for more research to fully understand its effects on human health. The article stated that "there is no conclusive evidence that 5G poses a health risk," citing the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) as sources.

The article also noted that the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) has established guidelines for safe exposure limits to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields, including those used in 5G technology. These guidelines are in line with recommendations from the WHO and other reputable health organizations.

Contrary to claims that Scientific American has outright condemned 5G technology as "not safe," the magazine has consistently emphasized the need for further research and caution. In a statement on their website, Scientific American notes that "there is no conclusive evidence that 5G is causing harm, but more research is needed to fully understand its effects."

In conclusion, while Scientific American has expressed concerns about the potential health risks of 5G technology, it has not issued a blanket warning that the technology is not safe. Instead, the magazine has called for further research and emphasized the need for caution.

Asteroid Impact Risk vs COVID-19 Mortality: A Reality Check

The claim that there is a higher chance of an asteroid hitting Earth on February 11, 2020, than dying from COVID-19 has been circulating online. However, a closer look at the facts reveals a different story.

Firstly, regarding the asteroid threat, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) continuously monitor near-Earth asteroids for potential threats. According to NASA's Near-Earth Object Program, there were no reported near-Earth asteroids that posed a significant threat to Earth on February 11, 2020. In fact, NASA's Sentry Risk Table, which provides a comprehensive list of near-Earth asteroids with a potential impact risk, does not list any notable threats on that date.

On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic had already begun spreading globally by February 2020. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the first reported cases of COVID-19 were detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and by February 2020, the virus had spread to over 20 countries. The WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020.

In terms of mortality, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in millions of reported deaths worldwide. According to the WHO, as of February 11, 2020, there were over 43,000 reported cases and 1,000 reported deaths globally.

Comparing the two claims, the available data suggests that the risk of dying from COVID-19 on February 11, 2020, was significantly higher than the risk of an asteroid hitting Earth on that date. In fact, the chances of dying from COVID-19 on February 11, 2020, were estimated to be around 0.002% (1 in 50,000), based on the reported deaths and cases at that time. The risk of an asteroid impact on that specific date is virtually zero, given the lack of any notable near-Earth asteroids identified by NASA and the ESA.

In conclusion, while asteroids do pose a threat to Earth, the available evidence suggests that the risk of dying from COVID-19 on February 11, 2020, was far higher than the risk of an asteroid hitting the planet on that date.

Fact-Checking the Claim of Asteroid Impact Risk vs. COVID-19 Mortality

The claim that there is a greater chance of an asteroid hitting Earth on February 11, 2020, than dying from COVID-19 has been circulating online. To evaluate this claim, we need to examine the available data and evidence.

Firstly, let's look at the risk of an asteroid impact. According to NASA, the likelihood of a large asteroid impact that could cause significant damage to Earth is extremely low. NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) monitors near-Earth objects (NEOs) and estimates that the likelihood of a catastrophic asteroid impact in the next century is about 1 in 1.5 million. In fact, the chances of being struck by a meteorite fragment from space are estimated to be about 1 in 1.9 million.

On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the mortality rate for COVID-19 is estimated to be around 0.5-1.5%. This means that the chance of dying from COVID-19 is significantly higher than the risk of being struck by a meteorite fragment.

In terms of the specific date of February 11, 2020, there were no reported asteroid sightings or near-misses by NASA or other reputable space agencies on that date. While it is possible that a small asteroid could have passed close to Earth on that day, there is no evidence to suggest that it posed a significant threat.

In conclusion, the available evidence suggests that the claim is entirely unfounded. The risk of an asteroid hitting Earth on February 11, 2020, is extremely low, while the risk of dying from COVID-19 is significantly higher. This claim is likely a misunderstanding of the relative risks and can be safely dismissed as an exaggeration.

| 1 | What is the case fatality rate of COVID-19? | The case fatality rate of COVID-19 is not constant. This was clear right from the start of the pandemic. |
| 2 | What was the time period being compared in the claim that there is more chance of an asteroid hitting Earth on 02/11/2020 than dying from COVID-19? | It shows the CFR for COVID-19 in several locations in China during the early stages of the outbreak, from the beginning of January to 20th February 2020. |
| 3 | How do the case fatality rates of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV compare to the case fatality rate of COVID-19? | As comparisons, the table shows the case fatality rates for other disease outbreaks. The CFR of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were high: 10% and 34%, respectively.13 |
| 4 | What was the case fatality ratio for COVID-19 in China as of 20 February 2020? | Case fatality ratio for COVID-19 in China over time and by location, as of 20 February 2020 – Figure 4 in WHO (2020)11 |
| 5 | What is the case fatality rate of COVID-19? | In the media, it is often the “case fatality rate” that is talked about when the risk of death from COVID-19 is discussed.1 |
| 6 | What is the case fatality rate of the Spanish flu? | But 2.7% is often misreported as the case fatality rate – which is wrong, because not everyone in the world was infected with the virus that caused the Spanish flu. |
| 7 | What does the difficulty in measuring and interpreting the case fatality rate of COVID-19 imply about the likelihood of dying from the disease? | In order to understand what the case fatality rate can and cannot tell us about a disease outbreak such as COVID-19, it’s important to understand why it is difficult to measure and interpret the numbers. |
| 8 | Does the claim that there is more chance of an asteroid hitting Earth on 02/11/2020 than dying from COVID-19 imply that COVID-19 is less deadly than the Spanish flu? | One estimate for the death toll of the Spanish flu, by Johnson and Mueller (2002), is that the pandemic killed 50 million people.2 That would have been 2.7% of the world population at the time. |
| 9 | How is the chance of dying from COVID-19 calculated? | It’s calculated by dividing the number of deaths from the disease by the total population. For instance, if there were 10 deaths in a population of 1,000, the crude mortality rate would be [10 / 1,000], or 1%. |
| 10 | How does the uncertainty of COVID-19 cases affect the comparison of the risk of dying from COVID-19 versus the risk of an asteroid hitting Earth? | However, as we explain here, the total number of cases of COVID-19 is not known. One big reason for this is that not everyone with COVID-19 is tested.8,9 |

**baseline Justification**:

```
Q11: What is the estimated chance of an asteroid hitting Earth on 02/11/2020?
A11: The chances of an asteroid hitting Earth on November 2, 2020, are one in 1.3 million, according to NASA. The asteroid, called 2020 VT4, is about 50 feet in size and is expected to fly by Earth at 7:25 p.m. ET. It will come within about 13,000 miles of our planet, which is closer than many satellites in orbit around Earth. The asteroid is not expected to make it to the surface. The chances of it hitting Earth are so small that the likelihood of dying from COVID-19 is much higher. As of October 31, 2020, there have been 1.1 million reported cases of COVID-19 in the United States, and 36,000 reported deaths. The chances of dying from COVID-19 are about 1 in 30,000. So, if you’re planning on being outside on November 2, 2020, you have a much greater chance of dying from COVID-19 than you do of being hit by an asteroid.

Fact-Checking Nigeria's Urban Population Claim

The claim that 52% of Nigeria's current population lives in urban areas is a frequently cited statistic. However, upon closer examination, we find that this figure requires verification.

According to the National Population Commission of Nigeria and the United Nations, the country's estimated population as of 2020 stands at approximately 202 million people. While there are various sources that suggest a significant portion of Nigeria's population resides in urban areas, the actual percentage is not as straightforward as the claimed 52%.

The Nigerian National Population Commission reports that in 2020, about 47.3% of the population lived in urban areas, which is significantly lower than the claimed 52%. This data is consistent with other reputable sources, including the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), which also puts the urban population percentage at around 47.3% in 2020.

On the other hand, some online sources and reports suggest that the urban population might be higher, citing estimates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that put the figure at around 55%. However, these numbers appear to be based on incomplete or outdated data and are not corroborated by other reliable sources.

In conclusion, while Nigeria's urban population is undoubtedly growing, the available evidence suggests that the actual percentage of the population living in urban areas is closer to 47.3% rather than the claimed 52%. Until more comprehensive and up-to-date data becomes available, we cannot confirm or refute the claim with absolute certainty.

Fact-checking Nigeria's Urban Population Claim

The claim that 52% of Nigeria's current population lives in urban areas has been circulating in various reports and studies. However, a closer examination of the data reveals conflicting evidence and ambiguity surrounding this figure.

According to the World Bank's data from 2020, Nigeria's urban population is approximately 49.3% of the total population, not 52%. The World Bank's Urban Agglomeration data is based on the United Nations' definition of an urban agglomeration, which includes the population of a city proper and the surrounding metropolitan area.

On the other hand, a report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of Nigeria, released in 2020, estimated that 52.1% of the country's population resides in urban areas. However, this figure is based on the 2020 population census, which is still a subject of debate and controversy due to concerns over accuracy and completeness of the data.

Additionally, a study published in the Journal of Development and Agricultural Economics in 2019 found that the urban population of Nigeria is actually around 45.5%, contradicting both the World Bank and NBS figures. This discrepancy may be attributed to differences in data collection methods, definitions of urban areas, and census methodologies.

In conclusion, the claim that 52% of Nigeria's population lives in urban areas is not entirely supported by the available evidence. While the National Bureau of Statistics' report suggests a higher figure, it is based on a disputed census data. The World Bank's data provides a lower estimate, while the academic study presents a figure that is even lower. Therefore, further research and clarification are needed to determine the accurate percentage of Nigeria's population living in urban areas.

2018 Police-Involved Fatalities in the United States

The claim suggests that 558 people were killed by the police in 2018, with 201 of those fatalities occurring while in police custody. However, this assertion requires verification through credible sources.

According to the Washington Post's database, which tracks police shootings in the United States, there were 987 reported police shootings in 2018, resulting in 995 fatalities. This figure is higher than the claimed 558 deaths by police.

Regarding the claim that 201 people died in police custody, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) reported that in 2018, there were 1,114 deaths while in police custody, but only 1,004 of those were due to natural causes, accidents, or homicides not related to police actions. However, the BJS also reported 337 deaths were caused by police actions, which is more than the claimed 201.

In conclusion, while the claim's accuracy regarding the total number of fatalities caused by police is disputed, the claim's assertion that 201 people died in police custody appears to be an underestimation. However, there is limited information available about the remaining 357 deaths that occurred while in police custody, which may be due to other causes.

Police-Involved Fatalities in 2018: A Review of Available Data

The claim that 558 people were killed by the police in 2018 while 201 people died in police custody has been widely reported. However, upon reviewing various sources, it appears that the numbers provided are not entirely accurate.

According to the Washington Post's database, which tracks police shootings and other police-related deaths in the United States, there were 987 reported fatal police shootings in 2018, resulting in 1,004 fatalities. This number includes not only actual shootings but also deaths caused by other means, such as vehicle pursuits or police pursuit on foot.

Regarding deaths in police custody, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) reported that there were 544 deaths in local jail custody in 2018. However, this number includes deaths that occurred in jail facilities, not necessarily in police custody. The BJS also reported that there were 372 deaths in state and federal prison custody in 2018, but again, this number is not directly related to police custody.

The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program reported that in 2018, there were 459 deaths in law enforcement custody, which is the closest to the claim of 201 deaths in police custody. However, it's essential to note that this number might not be comprehensive, as not all law enforcement agencies submit data to the FBI.

In conclusion, while there is some overlap between the reported numbers, the claim that 558 people were killed by the police in 2018 is partially supported by the Washington Post's database, which reports 1,004 fatalities. However, the claim of 201 people dying in police custody is not entirely supported. The BJS and FBI reports provide conflicting information, and a more comprehensive understanding of police custody deaths is needed. Therefore, the claim is partially accurate but requires more precise and comprehensive data to be confirmed.

#### Hypothetical Fact-Checking Documents

**baseline FC documents**:

*Docs Perspective*:

```
The claim that the number of North American bison has been reduced to only twenty-seven individuals due to colonizers is highly inaccurate and lacks historical context. 

Historical records indicate that the pre-colonization population of bison in North America was estimated to be between 30-60 million individuals. However, due to overhunting by European colonizers and the introduction of diseases to which the bison had no immunity, the population drastically declined. By the late 19th century, there were only around 300 individuals remaining in the wild. 

The conservation efforts of the late 19th and early 20th centuries helped to reintroduce and establish bison populations in various national parks and reserves. Today, there are over 30,000 bison in conservation herds across North America, with some populations still thriving in their natural habitats. 

While the impact of colonization on the bison population was devastating, the claim of only twenty-seven individuals surviving is an exaggeration and an oversimplification of the complex history of bison conservation. While the population did come perilously close to extinction, the numbers were never this low, and conservation efforts have since restored the bison population to a significant scale.
```

```
The claim that the number of North American bison was reduced to only twenty-seven individuals due to colonizers is largely exaggerated and lacks concrete historical evidence to support it.

Historically, the bison population in North America was significantly impacted by overhunting and habitat loss due to the expansion of European colonization. However, there is no credible source that supports the claim that the population was reduced to only twenty-seven individuals. 

According to the National Park Service, the estimated population of American bison in the early 19th century was around 30-60 million. By the late 19th century, the population had declined drastically to only a few hundred individuals. The last wild bison in the United States was killed in 1889, and the species was on the brink of extinction.

However, conservation efforts and disease transmission from domestic cattle led to the establishment of small bison herds in national parks and wildlife reserves. By the 1920s, there were around 500 bison in the United States. Through continued conservation efforts, the population has continued to grow, with an estimated 30,000-40,000 bison in the United States and Canada today.

In conclusion, while the decline of the bison population was indeed caused by colonizers, the claim that it was reduced to only twenty-seven individuals is not supported by historical records or credible sources. Instead, the population was significantly reduced, but not to such a low number, and has since been rebuilt through conservation efforts.

Fact-checking Judith Collins' Environmental Stance and Oravida Connection

The claim that New Zealand opposition leader Judith Collins is opposed to new environmental legislation due to her connection to Oravida, a local water and dairy company that exports produce to China, has been circulating online. However, a closer examination of the facts reveals a more nuanced situation.

On one hand, there is evidence suggesting Judith Collins has indeed voiced skepticism about certain environmental regulations, which could be perceived as aligning with the interests of Oravida. For instance, in a 2020 interview with the New Zealand Herald, Collins expressed concerns about the economic implications of stricter environmental regulations, stating that they could hinder the country's economic growth. Oravida, as a significant player in New Zealand's dairy industry, would likely be affected by such regulations.

Furthermore, Collins has received criticism for her presence at an Oravida event in China in 2019, where she was photographed with the company's executives. While Collins has denied any wrongdoing, the optics of her association with the company have raised eyebrows among environmental advocates.

On the other hand, there is also evidence that suggests Collins' stance on environmental issues is more complex than a straightforward opposition to new legislation. In the same 2020 interview, Collins emphasized the need for a balanced approach to environmental protection and economic growth, suggesting that she is not opposed to environmental regulations per se, but rather wants them to be implemented in a way that does not harm the country's economy.

Moreover, Collins has also spoken out on specific environmental issues, such as the need for greater protection of New Zealand's native forests and the importance of addressing climate change. These statements suggest that she is not entirely opposed to environmental legislation, but rather is advocating for a more nuanced approach.

In conclusion, while there is some evidence to suggest that Judith Collins' connection to Oravida may have influenced her stance on environmental legislation, it is not a clear-cut case of conflict of interest. Collins' statements and actions suggest a more complex position on environmental issues, one that balances economic and environmental concerns. Therefore, the claim that she is opposed to new environmental legislation solely due to her connection to Oravida is not entirely supported by the evidence.

Rating: Partially supported, with some evidence suggesting a potential conflict of interest, but not conclusive proof of a direct link between Collins' connection to Oravida and her environmental stance.

Fact-Checking Judith Collins' Environmental Legislation Stance

A recent claim has been circulating that Judith Collins, the leader of the opposition in New Zealand, is opposed to new environmental legislation due to her connection with Oravida, a local water and dairy company that exports its products to China. However, a closer examination of the facts reveals a more nuanced situation.

While Judith Collins is indeed a director of Oravida, a company that has faced criticism for its environmental practices and water usage in New Zealand, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that her opposition to the new environmental legislation is motivated by her affiliation with the company. In fact, Collins has publicly stated that her opposition to the legislation is based on concerns about its economic impact on the country and its potential to drive businesses overseas.

According to a report by the New Zealand Herald, Collins has expressed concerns about the potential job losses and economic disruption that the new legislation could cause, particularly in the rural areas. She has also emphasized the need for a more balanced approach that takes into account the needs of both the environment and the economy.

It is worth noting that Oravida has faced criticism for its environmental practices, including concerns about its water usage and potential impact on New Zealand's water resources. However, it is unclear whether this criticism has any direct connection to Collins' stance on the environmental legislation.

In an interview with the New Zealand Herald, Collins stated, "I'm not opposed to environmental legislation, I'm opposed to [the] rushed and ill-conceived manner in which it's being presented." When asked about her connection to Oravida, she emphasized that her role as a director is a voluntary one and that she is not involved in the company's day-to-day operations.

While some critics have raised concerns about Collins' connection to Oravida, there is currently no concrete evidence to support the claim that her opposition to the environmental legislation is motivated by her affiliation with the company. Until more information becomes available, it appears that Collins' stance on the legislation is based on her concerns about its potential economic impact, rather than any personal gain or conflict of interest.

**Conclusion:** While Judith Collins is indeed a director of Oravida, a company that has faced environmental criticism, there is currently no concrete evidence to support the claim that her opposition to the new environmental legislation is motivated by her connection to the company. Collins' stated concerns about the legislation's economic impact and her emphasis on a balanced approach suggest that her stance is more nuanced than suggested by the claim.
