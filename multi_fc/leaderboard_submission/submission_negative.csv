Is the claim that the speaker is watching cheaters and phony ballots related to the potential delay in election results reporting?

13,Wearing face masks will stop the spread of covid 19,"Do face masks help prevent the spread of COVID-19?		
Face masks, among other measures such as isolation, quarantine, lockdowns, social distancing and vaccination, have been used for prevention in a wide range of disease outbreaks and medical settings, and there is currently a general consensus that surgical and cloth masks help prevent infected individuals from spreading coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).2,3 Surprisingly, given the logic of their utility, there is less of a consensus that surgical/cloth masks also protect the wearer and many government health organizations did not initially recommend wearing them during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.4,5		

Does wearing face masks have a significant effect on the spread of COVID-19?		
Finding out whether face masks indeed reduce the spread of COVID-19 is thus important. Against the available evidence from clinical studies or previous pandemics, we ask: Can we identify a significant effect of face masks on the spread of COVID-19 by looking at the development of registered COVID-19 cases?		

What is the effectiveness of wearing face masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19?		
Among the most effective preventative behaviors is face mask wearing, which has been extensively supported to reduce airborne transmission of viruses (Leung et al., 2020; O'Dowd et al., 2020); however, many people are resistant to face mask wearing despite the effectiveness of the practice, which poses extreme risks in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic (Howard, 2020; Lyu & Wehby, 2020).		

Does the evidence support the claim that wearing face masks will stop the spread of COVID-19?		
National and international public health guidance on the use of face masks is based on low certainty direct evidence of clinical effectiveness, indirect evidence that supports plausibility of effectiveness, as well as a consideration that SARS-CoV-2 appears to be more infectious than many other respiratory pathogens, including during the presymptomatic phase of the disease44, highlighting the necessity of considering a range of infection prevention and control measures, including face masks, to reduce the spread of infection.		

Does wearing face masks reduce the transmission of COVID-19?		
Recent research has shown that face masks could reduce the transmission of the virus (28, 29), resulting in many governments advising or mandating the use of masks for healthy individuals in the community.		

Does the evidence suggest that face masks are effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19 in the community?		
However, there is an essential distinction between absence of evidence and evidence of absence. Evidence that face masks can provide effective protection against respiratory infections in the community is scarce, as acknowledged in recommendations from the UK and Germany.7, 8 However, face masks are widely used by medical workers as part of droplet precautions when caring for patients with respiratory infections.		

Does wearing a face mask in public places reduce the spread of COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention?		
Face masks are a simple way to help decrease coronavirus transmission and save lives. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wearing a face mask in public places has been shown to reduce the spread of COVID-19, because those who are pre-symptomatic can spread the virus before showing symptoms.		

Can wearing face masks reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection?		
Previous studies on the use of face masks by healthy people in the community have considered other respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-1, influenza, or influenza-like illness (ILI), and have provided some weak evidence that face masks may reduce the risk of infection, particularly when implemented early, combined with hand hygiene and subject to good levels of compliance26–35.		

Can wearing face masks help reduce the transmission of COVID-19?		
Studies of face masks to reduce transmission of influenza or ILI in households or schools have suggested that adherence with wearing face masks may play an important role in determining their effectiveness31,46, although further research is needed.		

Does wearing face masks have any association with reducing the spread of a similar coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)?		
Although researchers found no definitive clinical studies evaluating the effectiveness of masks to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, they did find evidence that facial coverings were associated with decreasing the spread of another coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.

Published research on the effectiveness of border barriers is limited and offers conflicting results in terms of how much of a role barriers play in deterring unauthorized entry in the U.S.		

Does the evidence suggest that barriers are effective in reducing the number of unauthorized border crossings?		
Border barriers can discourage unauthorized border crossings, but the research is mixed in terms of how much they deter migrants from entering the U.S. without permission.		

Does the deployment of barriers in the US lead to a shift in the location of illegal activities, such as drug smuggling and human trafficking, rather than a complete decrease in these activities?		
CBP figures for drugs - excluding marijuana - seized on the southern border also show most come through ports of entry, although a report by the Congressional Research Service does state that border barriers can serve to push people to cross in places where they are more likely to be ""detected, intercepted, and detained"".		

What is the relationship between the deployment of barriers and the decrease in illegal drug, border crossings, and human smuggling activities in the United States?

What is the effect of the border fence on the routes and locations of illegal immigrants attempting to cross the US-Mexico border?		
The U.S. Border Patrol itself has admitted that some of this change in illegal immigration patterns has stemmed from increased tactical infrastructure along the border, as the now largely complete border fence pushes illegal immigrants toward less populated and more dangerous areas.[85]		

What is the effect of deploying barriers on illegal activities at the US border?		
Considerable evidence shows that the USBP's historical strategy of ""Prevention through Deterrence,"" whereby agents and resources including border fencing and other barriers have been concentrated along urban areas and areas traditionally featuring high levels of illegal entry, has succeeded in changing the flow of illegal migration.		

What is the primary method of entry for narcotics into the US, according to the analysis of data from the southern border?

16,The plentiful evidence we have indicates that masks would not meaningfully help with aerosol transmission of COVID 19.,"Can wearing a face mask be effective in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 if people do not comply with wearing them or if it leads to increased contact due to a false sense of security?		
Even though there is now significant agreement in the medical literature that respiratory transmission of COVID-19 is the dominant vector (Meyerowitz et al. 2020), and many clinical studies have shown that face masks reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and similar illnesses (Chu et al. 2020, Prather et al. 2020, Leung et al. 2020, Greenhalgh et al. 2020), a face mask mandate may not be effective in practice if it fails to increase the prevalence of mask wearing (compliance), or if it leads to increased contact due to a false sense of security.		

Does the evidence suggest that N95 masks are more effective than surgical masks in preventing the transmission of COVID-19?		
Although surgical masks have lower filtration efficiency than N95 respirators, observational studies have shown no significant benefit of N95 masks over surgical masks for prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (odds ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.22-3.33) or other respiratory viruses (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.85-1.08).3 For health care workers, routine care for a patient with COVID-19 if both are wearing surgical masks is not considered to be a high-risk occupational exposure.3 Yet, SARS-CoV-2 viral particles have been identified in the air for several hours after an aerosolizing event simulated in a laboratory and near air vents in a clinical setting.3 A group of 239 scientists recently signed an open letter urging the World Health Organization and other international public health bodies to recommend additional precautions (though not N95 masks specifically) to protect against potential airborne transmission, highlighting several recent superspreading events in which SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurred in poorly ventilated areas.5 These instances raise concern for the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission; however, the viability and infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in aerosol form remains unknown.		

Does the evidence suggest that masks are effective in reducing the transmission of COVID-19?		
However, a recent study in patients with seasonal coronaviruses has demonstrated that surgical face masks significantly reduced detection of viral RNA in aerosols and shows a trend in reducing viral RNA in droplets.4 A recent meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials also showed that surgical masks are as effective as N95 masks in reducing transmission of influenza‐like diseases.6 If the result from a case–control study during the SARS‐CoV‐1 outbreak in Hong Kong is any indication, frequent masks use (mainly surgical) in public places can be protective by 64%.7		

Do surgical face masks and masks made of dense cotton fabrics effectively prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 into the environment through the coughing of patients with COVID-19?		
The answer is highly relevant to guide public behaviour (Leung et al., 2020). One study suggests that a surgical face mask and masks made of dense cotton fabrics apparently cannot effectively prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 into the environment through the coughing of patients with COVID-19 (Bae et al., 2020; Klompas, Morris, Sinclair, Pearson, & Shenoy, 2020).		

Does the effectiveness of masks in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 depend on population compliance and the masks' ability to reduce viral transmission?		
The use of face masks can be effective at reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-21, 2. Theoretical studies show that the extent of disease outbreaks is dependent on population compliance with mask usage and effectiveness of the masks at reducing viral transmission3.		

Does the evidence support the claim that masks are not effective in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 through aerosols?		
Although no studies have examined SARS-CoV-2 transmission directly, data from previous epidemics (6,7) support the use of universal face coverings as a policy to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as does observational data for COVID-19 in an analysis of 194 countries that found a negative association between duration of a face mask or respirator policy and per-capita coronavirus-related mortality; in countries that did not recommend face masks and respirators, the per-capita coronavirus-related mortality increased each week by 54.3% after the index case, compared with 8.0% in those countries with masking policies (CT Leffler, Virginia Commonwealth University, unpublished data, 2020).§ Similar outcomes have been observed for other respiratory virus outbreaks, including the 2002–04 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (6) and the 2007–08 influenza season (7).

How does wearing a mask help in preventing the spread of COVID-19?		
Wearing masks against COVID-19 is beneficial in suppressing pandemic spread, not through preventing the wearer from being infected but by preventing the wearer from infecting others, according to suggestions from the World Health Organization (WHO, 2020a,b,c) and lessons from previous pandemics, such as the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic and the 2009 influenza A virus subtype H1N1 pandemic (Mniszewski et al., 2014; Leung et al., 2020).		

Can face masks prevent the transmission of COVID-19?		
Another study, “Respiratory virus shedding in exhaled breath and efficacy of face masks”, published in Nature Research on 3 April, found that face masks could prevent the transmission of human coronaviruses by filtering respiratory droplets.		

According to the National Academies of Sciences Rapid Expert Consultation on the Effectiveness of Fabric Masks for the COVID-19 Pandemic, what does the evidence suggest about the effectiveness of fabric masks in reducing the transmission of COVID-19?

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the flu was responsible for an estimated 38,000 deaths in the United States alone during the 2016-2017 flu season, and an even greater number were hospitalized with the illness.		

What was the actual number of flu-related deaths reported in the US during week 15 of 2020?		
During week 15 of 2020, 380 flu-related deaths, not zero, were reported. The trajectory of deaths during the 2019-2020 flu season is similar to the curves in previous years, with the possible exception of the 2017-2018 season, which was particularly deadly (Figure 2).		

Did the number of flu deaths in the US decrease in 2020 compared to the previous year?		
During the same period, flu accounted for an estimated 24,000 to 62,000 deaths in the country. The overall dynamic of the 2019-2020 flu season is comparable to previous years, with the exception of a sharper than usual drop in cases in April.		

What was the estimated number of flu deaths in the United States during the 2019-2020 influenza season, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)?		
Preliminary data suggests there were an estimated 24,000-62,000 flu deaths for the 2019-20 influenza season, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).		

How many flu deaths were there in America in the 2018-2019 flu season?		
From October 2018 to May 2019 the FluSurv-NET data accounted for about 7,000 influenza-associated deaths, which CDC ultimately used to estimate 34,200 total deaths for the 2018-2019 flu season.		

What was the total number of flu-associated deaths among children in the United States during the 2019-2020 flu season?		
Since flu-associated deaths in children became a nationally notifiable condition in 2004, the total number of flu-associated deaths among children during one season has ranged from 37 (during the 2011-2012 season) to 186 (during the 2017-18 season, as of April 19, 2019); this excludes the 2009 pandemic, when 358 pediatric deaths from April 15, 2009 through October 2, 2010 were reported to CDC.		

What was the number of flu deaths in America in 2020 compared to the previous year?		
The flu season was particularly severe last year, meaning the drop in influenza deaths from 2019 to 2020 is even more pronounced.		

How did the number of flu deaths in America compare to the five-year average in 2020?

Did the CDC's annual estimates of flu deaths in 2020 substantially overstate the actual number of deaths caused by influenza?		
Based on the figure of approximately 60 000 COVID-19 deaths in the US as of the end of April 2020, this ratio suggests only a 1.0-fold to 2.6-fold change from the CDC-estimated seasonal influenza deaths calculated during the previous 7 full seasons.3 From our analysis, we infer that either the CDC’s annual estimates substantially overstate the actual number of deaths caused by influenza or that the current number of COVID-19 counted deaths substantially understates the actual number of deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2, or both.

Do researchers believe that improper use and discarding of used and contaminated face masks can lead to the spread of infections?		
These conclusions led researchers to speculate that antibacterial masks could be an effective way to reduce secondary transmission of infections, a concern surrounding improper use and irresponsible discarding of used and contaminated face masks.		

Does wearing face masks prevent the spread of respiratory viral infections, but does it also have any negative effects on the wearer, such as causing infections from bacteria like staphylococcus?		
If healthcare workers wear surgical masks, there is good evidence that it limits the spread of respiratory viral infections in hospitals.		

Can wearing face masks lead to bacterial colonization in the upper respiratory tract of healthcare workers?		
Efficacy of face masks and respirators in preventing upper respiratory tract bacterial colonization and co-infection in hospital healthcare workers		

Does wearing face masks have any negative effects on health, such as causing infections from bacteria like staphylococcus?		
A systematic review on the efficacy of face coverings against respiratory viruses analyzed 19 randomized trials and concluded that use of face masks and respirators appeared to be protective in both health care and community settings (8).		

Does wearing face masks have any effect on the risk of infection?		
Previous studies on the use of face masks by healthy people in the community have considered other respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-1, influenza, or influenza-like illness (ILI), and have provided some weak evidence that face masks may reduce the risk of infection, particularly when implemented early, combined with hand hygiene and subject to good levels of compliance26–35.

Facebook posts stated on October 24, 2020 in Facebook post: An “anti-Black Lives Matter” flag replaced the American flag behind President Trump during a Waukesha campaign rally.		

What movement is the 'anti-Black Lives Matter' flag associated with?		
Those who use the flag say it is a way to support police. But the image has come to be associated with the Blue Lives Matter movement, whose very formation was a response to the Black Lives Matter movement.		

What was the reason for the controversy at the Sept. 1 meeting?		
A request to fly the Black Lives Matter flag sparked controversy at the Sept. 1 meeting, with several residents accusing the organization of being anti-Semitic.

Did President Trump falsely describe a person as a leader of the Black Lives Matter movement?		
In his tweet, Trump falsely described Newsome as a ""Black Lives Matter leader."" But in reality, Newsome has repeatedly angered the founders of the official Black Lives Matter movement by adopting their moniker and raising money off of it, while espousing an approach to racial justice that is far more militant than the main branch of the Black Lives Matter movement.		

Is the 'anti-Black Lives Matter' flag associated with the Blue Lives Matter movement?		
The flags have been used in association with the Blue Lives Matter movement, a pro-police group.		

Did the 'anti-Black Lives Matter' flag replace the American flag behind President Trump at a Waukesha campaign rally?

Was the flag displayed behind President Trump during a Waukesha campaign rally an official ""police flag"" or an ""anti-Black Lives Matter"" flag?		
I am aware of the possibility that this was not the Blue Lives Matter flag, but the ""police flag,"" but just like any symbol, the official meaning does not reduce its effect to be a covert symbol of white supremacy, even if unintentional.		

What groups is the 'anti-Black Lives Matter' flag associated with?		
Since then, the flag in question has become closely associated with white nationalist groups. In the 2017 “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the blue-lined flag appeared alongside Nazi and Confederate flags.

43,Donald Trump said that $15 an hour is too much for essential workers,"What is Donald Trump's stance on the $15 minimum wage?		
A $15 minimum wage would increase wages for over 33 million U.S. workers and lift 1.3 million people out of poverty—nearly half of them children.82 However, days before the passage of the Raise the Wage Act, the administration issued a Statement of Administration Policy recommending that President Trump veto the bill if it reaches his desk.83		

Did Donald Trump previously believe that wages were too high?		
Donald Trump said Tuesday he would support raising the federal minimum wage to $10 an hour, a departure from his previous assertion that wages are “too high.”		

Did the Congressional Budget Office estimate that raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour would result in 1.3 million workers losing their jobs?		
Biden disagreed that a higher minimum wage would lead to companies going out of business. Studies on the topic remain mixed; the Congressional Budget Office estimated in July 2019 that 1.3 million workers would be out of a job if the federal minimum wage was raised to $15 an hour, but other studies have disputed this outcome.		

Did Donald Trump express an opinion on the proposed $15 an hour minimum wage?

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., two-time runner-up for the party’s presidential nomination.		

Is the proposed $15 an hour minimum wage higher than the historical high point of the U.S. wage floor?		
Raising the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2024 would bring the U.S. wage floor above its historical high point, both in absolute terms and relative to the wages of middle-wage workers.		

Does the claim that $15 an hour is too much for essential workers align with the public support for raising the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2024?		
This suggests the wage issue is still ripe for organizing, and public support will remain high. A current bill to raise the federal minimum to $15 by 2024 would benefit 41 million workers (Owens, 2017).		

Does Donald Trump support increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour?		
- Increase the federal minimum wage to $15 across the country, disproportionately benefitting women and people of color who make up the majority of workers earning under $15 an hour.		

What was the federal minimum wage rate that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez advocated for at the time of her statement about Donald Trump's stance on a $15 an hour federal minimum wage?

Herd immunity against COVID-19 should be achieved by protecting people through vaccination, not by exposing them to the pathogen that causes the disease.		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a recommended method for achieving herd immunity against COVID-19?		
Herd immunity for COVID-19 through natural infection can pose many challenges. COVID-19 can cause serious complications and millions of deaths, therefore the experts recommend trying to achieve herd immunity through vaccination.		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a scientifically supported method for creating herd immunity against COVID-19?		
However, according to the World Health Organization, “Attempts to reach herd immunity through exposing people to a virus are scientifically problematic and morally unethical.”		

According to the World Health Organization, what is the recommended method for achieving herd immunity against COVID-19?		
WHO supports achieving 'herd immunity' through vaccination, not by allowing a disease to spread through any segment of the population, as this would result in unnecessary cases and deaths.		

Is deliberately infecting children with COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a viable alternative to vaccination for achieving herd immunity?		
A vaccine for the virus that causes COVID-19 would be an ideal approach to achieving herd immunity. Vaccines create immunity without causing illness or resulting complications.		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a scientifically supported method for creating herd immunity against COVID-19?		
Managing COVID-19 by allowing herd immunity to develop in low-risk populations while protecting the most vulnerable is ""a dangerous fallacy unsupported by the scientific evidence,"" warn an international group of 80 researchers in an open letter.		

Is deliberately infecting children at ""pox parties"" a viable method for creating herd immunity against COVID-19 without a vaccine?

45,Cutting the umbilical cord straight away deliberately denies the baby natural immunity so that medical professionals have a reason to vaccinate and medicate them.,"What are the benefits of delayed umbilical cord clamping?		
Extensive research into the subject of umbilical cord clamping over the last few decades has now shown that rather than clamping the umbilical cord immediately, leaving it to pulsate and transfer the blood from the placenta to the baby, as nature intended, has many proven benefits both long-term and short-term for a new-born.		

Does the World Health Organization recommend delayed umbilical cord clamping?		
Despite the available evidence that delayed umbilical cord clamping is more beneficial to infants, as well as the existence of 2014 WHO recommendation that the umbilical cord should be clamped between 1 and 3 minutes, its implementation is still low in many countries including Tanzania.		

Does cutting the umbilical cord immediately after birth cause harm to the baby?		
It has now been shown to provide no benefit to the mother and to result in harm to the neonate. The clinical trial evidence relating to delayed cord clamping compared to immediate cord clamping is presented and the physiological rationale for delayed cord clamping is discussed in this paper.		

Has the recommended timing of umbilical cord clamping been changed from immediate clamping to delayed clamping?		
However, those protocols have since been revised to recommend delayed umbilical cord clamping (1). Thus, analysis of the timing of umbilical cord clamping in relation to postpartum haemorrhage is considered important.		

Does delaying the clamping of the umbilical cord increase the baby's iron stores and haemoglobin concentrations?		
A more liberal approach to delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in healthy term infants appears to be warranted, particularly in light of growing evidence that delayed cord clamping increases early haemoglobin concentrations and iron stores in infants.		

Is delayed cord clamping the standard practice for full-term births?		
Delayed cord clamping is not standard medical practice in full-term births. The standard of care in obstetrics right now only calls for delayed cord clamping with premature babies who are more in need of the increase in blood volume compared to full-term babies.		

Does immediate umbilical cord clamping have any benefits for the baby's health?		
Term and preterm infants appear to derive benefit from delayed umbilical cord clamping; therefore, delayed umbilical cord clamping for at least 30–60 seconds is recommended in term and preterm infants except when immediate umbilical cord clamping is necessary because of neonatal or maternal indications.		

Does delayed umbilical cord clamping provide any benefits to the baby?		
However, the authors concluded that given the benefit of delayed umbilical cord clamping in term infants, delayed cord clamping is beneficial overall, provided that the obstetrician–gynecologist or other obstetric care provider has the ability to monitor and treat jaundice.		

Does delayed cord clamping provide any benefits to the newborn in terms of immunity?		
Delayed cord clamping provides more placental transfusion between the placenta and the newborn, whereas immediate cord clamping allows for immediate resuscitation of the premature newborn by a neonatologist (193).		

What is the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommendation regarding the timing of cord clamping after birth?		
Delayed cord clamping appears to be helpful for both full-term and preterm babies. For this reason, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends delayed cord clamping for at least 30 to 60 seconds after birth for most babies.

46,The umbilical cord should not be cut until 1 hour after birth or they baby will not have enough blood right after birth.,"What are the benefits and risks of delayed cord clamping after birth?		
Delayed cord clamping, defined as waiting to clamp the umbilical cord for one to three minutes after birth or until cord pulsation has ceased, is associated with benefits in term infants, including higher birth weight, higher hemoglobin concentration, improved iron stores at six months, and improved respiratory transition.35 Benefits are even greater with preterm infants.36 However, delayed cord clamping is associated with an increase in jaundice requiring phototherapy.35 Delayed cord clamping is indicated with all deliveries unless urgent resuscitation is needed.		

What is the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommendation for the timing of umbilical cord clamping after birth?		
Recommendations for when to clamp and cut the cord differ. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) advises waiting 30 to 60 seconds after the birth of a preterm infant, but acknowledges there is insufficient evidence to support delayed cord clamping in full-term infants born in areas that do not lack resources.		

Is it recommended to cut the umbilical cord immediately after birth?		
Delaying cord clamping for at least 30–60 seconds after delivery is recommended by national and international organizations.1–6 In term newborns, delayed cord clamping has been shown to increase blood volume,7

Is it recommended to cut the umbilical cord immediately after birth, or is there a recommended delay in cutting the cord?		
Term and preterm infants appear to derive benefit from delayed umbilical cord clamping; therefore, delayed umbilical cord clamping for at least 30–60 seconds is recommended in term and preterm infants except when immediate umbilical cord clamping is necessary because of neonatal or maternal indications.		

Does the World Health Organization recommend waiting at least 1 minute after birth to cut the umbilical cord?		
Despite the available evidence that delayed umbilical cord clamping is more beneficial to infants, as well as the existence of 2014 WHO recommendation that the umbilical cord should be clamped between 1 and 3 minutes, its implementation is still low in many countries including Tanzania.		

What was the standard practice for umbilical cord clamping before 1960?		
Until 1960, delayed umbilical cord clamping (DCC) to promote placental transfusion was common; afterward, cord clamping immediately after birth became standard practice to reduce the risk of postpartum hemorrhage, although without evidence (1, 2).		

What is the recommended time frame for cutting the umbilical cord after birth?		
Delayed umbilical cord clamping is usually performed approximately 1-3 minutes after giving birth, unless the newborn needs resuscitation (help with breathing or circulation).		

What is the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' recommendation regarding the timing of umbilical cord clamping after birth?		
The ACOG does not endorse the practice of delayed cord clamping but rather suggests cord clamping should take place between 30 to 60 seconds after birth, since the ideal timing for cord clamping has yet to be established.		

Does delaying the clamping of the umbilical cord after birth increase the infant's blood volume?		
Traditionally, practitioners have clamped the umbilical cord immediately after birth. Previous studies have shown that delaying cord clamping results in a 20 to 30 percent increase in an infant’s blood volume.

Does Joe Biden's stance on fracking include a ban on existing drilling sites, or is it limited to new drilling sites on federal lands?		
Biden’s platform does not include a ban on fracking. But he has said in the past that he would oppose new drilling sites on federal lands — a stance that would have limited impact in Pennsylvania, where fracking is done on private land.		

Does Joe Biden plan to ban all fracking in the US?		
Political ads on Facebook in early June claimed that Biden sought to ban all fracking. However, during an April interview with KDKA TV news in Pittsburgh, Biden said he wouldn't shut down the fracking industry but merely wouldn't allow new fracking leases on federal land, which only represents 10 percent of all national leases.		

Does Joe Biden's plan propose a complete ban on fracking in the US?		
Biden's written plan never included a full ban on fracking; rather, it proposes ""banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters,"" not ending all new fracking anywhere or ending all existing fracking on public lands and waters.		

Did Joe Biden say he wants to ban fracking in the US?		
A Biden campaign spokesman clarified afterward that Biden wouldn’t ban fracking — he was referring only to his stated policy to ban new permits for oil and gas drilling on federal land and offshore, the Wall Street Journal reported.		

Has Joe Biden called for an outright ban on fracking in the US?		
In reality, Biden has not called for an outright ban on fracking. He correctly defended himself during the debate by saying he has said he does not support new drilling permits on federal land, but has not argued for banning fracking.		

Does Joe Biden plan on banning fracking in the US?		
Biden has repeatedly said he wouldn't ban fracking; the policies he has released call only for no new fracking on federal lands.		

Does Joe Biden plan to ban fracking in the US?		
But Biden denied any plans to ban fracking. The Democratic nominee said he will introduce policies to capture emissions from fracking as part of his clean energy plan.		

Does Joe Biden support a complete ban on fracking in the US?		
Biden publicly opposes an outright fracking ban, instead planning to abolish new gas and oil permits on federal land only.		

Does Joe Biden support a ban on fracking in the US?		
The claim that Joe Biden wants to eliminate fracking is false because it ignores his publicly stated opposition to such a ban.

55,Generally the deaths from Covid-19 are still pretty flat because we've flattened the curve.,"What does ""flattening the curve"" mean in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic?		
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) broke out in early December 2019, in Wuhan, China. It was not until late January of 2020 that it became a global pandemic, spreading across neighboring countries and beyond.1 For all the infected countries, the goal of containing the virus was to be achieved by flattening the “curve”, which simply meant attaining fewer new cases than the previous day.2 Flattening the curve became imminent to curtail the spread of the virus so as to reduce the burden on the healthcare system, allowing for better treatment and performance of healthcare workers.3		

Has the number of daily deaths from Covid-19 in South Korea remained relatively constant since February 20th?		
The pattern of COVID-19 deaths in South Korea has not followed the same clear epidemic pattern as cases (Fig. 1b), with a total of only 289 deaths up to and including July 13th, distributed throughout the period since February 20th with a peak, by date of the report, of only 9 deaths per day.		

Has the curve of COVID-19 deaths in Florida been flattened?		
While the definition of flattening the curve is subject to interpretation, within the past week Florida has seen some of the highest daily increases of both COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths since testing began in early March.		

Is the growth rate of total COVID-19 cases in Italy slowing down?		
The growth rate of total COVID-19 cases in Italy has been slowing since March 8, according to the Italian Civil Protection Department, and, in the past few days, the total new daily cases have finally started to shrink, suggesting Italy is ‘flattening the curve,’ meaning that it is slowing the spread of the virus.		

Does the claim that deaths from Covid-19 are still pretty flat because we've flattened the curve align with the evidence that the actual number of COVID-19 cases and deaths is unknown?		
[11] However, according to CDC, the actual number of COVID-19 cases and deaths is unknown. [12] Figures 1 and 2 show the reported cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, respectively, in the United States from March 7 through June 17, 2020.		

Does the number of confirmed or probable COVID-19-associated deaths accurately represent the total number of deaths attributable to the pandemic?		
Counting only confirmed or probable COVID-19–associated deaths, however, likely underestimates the number of deaths attributable to the pandemic.		

Is the number of deaths from Covid-19 in the United States still relatively stable?		
The sheer magnitude of the COVID-19 crisis is hard to fathom. As of the published date of this report, the death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic has topped 215,000 in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University.		

Does the number of deaths from COVID-19 grow at the same rate as the number of cases, with a time lag?		
- Looking at the number of deaths from COVID-19 provides an alternative measure. If a given percentage of people who contract COVID-19 die, then the number of deaths should grow at the same rate as the number of cases, but with a time lag.		

Does the claim that deaths from Covid-19 are still pretty flat mean that the number of cases per capita has not increased significantly in areas like Seattle, New York, and New Orleans?

The claim: Previous flu vaccines may have made President Donald Trump susceptible to COVID-19		

Is there a link between previous flu vaccines and an increased risk of contracting COVID-19?		
No study established a link between the flu vaccine and an increased risk of contracting COVID-19. Wolff, investigating viral interference among Department of Defence personnel concluded that the flu vaccine was not associated with viral interference and provides protection against influenza.		

Is there a link between previous flu vaccines and susceptibility to COVID-19?		
A recent study found no link between the flu vaccine and COVID-19 susceptibility, morbidity or mortality.		

Does previous flu vaccination increase a person's risk of getting COVID-19?

Does receiving a flu vaccine increase a person's risk of catching other respiratory viruses, such as COVID-19?		
In terms of whether the shot makes people more susceptible to other respiratory viruses, which in 2020 could include COVID-19, no strong scientific or medical evidence shows that flu shots increase people's risk of catching other viruses as of this writing.		

Is there any evidence that previous flu vaccines can make someone susceptible to COVID-19?		
COVID-19 and the flu are caused by viruses from completely different families. There’s currently no evidence that receiving the flu shot protects against COVID-19.		

Did previous flu vaccines increase the risk of infection with seasonal coronaviruses?		
This flaw led to the incorrect association between flu vaccination and seasonal coronavirus risk. When these researchers reexamined data from the first study using the correct methods, they found that flu vaccination did not increase the risk for infection with other respiratory viruses, including seasonal coronaviruses.		

Did the studies cited in the Instagram post support the claim that previous flu vaccinations made President Donald Trump susceptible to COVID-19?		
We rate this claim FALSE because it is not supported by our research. The two studies cited in the Instagram post to support the theory that Trump's past flu vaccinations put him at an increased risk for COVID-19 have nothing to do with the virus.		

Does the flu vaccine affect a person's susceptibility to COVID-19?		
In sum, given that finding — as well as the false misrepresentation of the DOD study by anti-vaccine advocates — and the fact that the CDC states a ""preponderance"" of scientific and medical evidence exists to suggest that the flu vaccine does not affect people's susceptibility to non-flu respiratory viruses, which in 2020 could include COVID-19, we rate this claim ""False"".		

Does receiving the flu vaccine increase the risk of contracting COVID-19?

82,In the US lockdowns are partly responsible for excess deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19 which were observed in 2020.,"What percentage of excess deaths in the US in March and April 2020 were attributed to COVID-19?		
The study, “Excess Deaths from COVID-19 and Other Causes, March-April 2020,” showed that only 65% of the excess deaths that occurred in March and April were attributed to COVID-19, meaning more than one-third were linked to other causes.		

Did the study find that the COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in deaths from non-COVID-19 causes?		
Previous studies of excess deaths (the gap between observed and expected deaths) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic found that publicly reported COVID-19 deaths underestimated the full death toll, which includes documented and undocumented deaths from the virus and non–COVID-19 deaths caused by disruptions from the pandemic.1,2 A previous analysis found that COVID-19 was cited in only 65% of excess deaths in the first weeks of the pandemic (March-April 2020); deaths from non–COVID-19 causes (eg, Alzheimer disease, diabetes, heart disease) increased sharply in 5 states with the most COVID-19 deaths.1 This study updates through August 1, 2020, the estimate of excess deaths and explores temporal relationships with state reopenings (lifting of coronavirus restrictions).		

What were the causes of the excess deaths in the US that were not directly attributed to COVID-19, as observed in 2020?		
This study updates a previous report of the estimated number of excess deaths in the US during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic through August 1, 2020, and describes causes of those deaths and temporal relationships with state lifting of coronavirus restrictions.		

What type of deaths in the US were observed in 2020 that were not directly attributed to COVID-19?		
This article presents provisional analysis of excess deaths in 2020 that did not involve the coronavirus (COVID-19), focussing on the weeks from which death registrations involving COVID-19 were first recorded.		

What types of deaths are included in the estimates of excess deaths mentioned in the evidence?		
Estimates of excess deaths can provide a comprehensive account of mortality related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including deaths that are directly or indirectly attributable to COVID-19.		

What percentage of excess all-cause deaths in 2020 in the US were not directly attributed to COVID-19?		
The number of excess all-cause deaths was 28% higher than those of COVID-19 deaths. They noted that,“the deaths officially attributed to COVID-19 accounted for 78% of the excess all-cause deaths, leaving 22% unattributed to COVID-19.		

What types of deaths were possibly misclassified or indirectly caused by the pandemic, according to the evidence?		
Finally, estimates of excess deaths attributed to COVID-19 might underestimate the actual number directly attributable to COVID-19, because deaths from other causes might represent misclassified COVID-19–related deaths or deaths indirectly caused by the pandemic.		

Did the reported Covid-19 mortality figures in the US accurately reflect the actual number of deaths in 2020?		
There are reports of excess mortality in some countries during the Covid-19 pandemic. Rivera et al. (2020) found that Covid-19 mortality figures in the US underestimate the actual death toll, and that Covid-19 mortality is likely to be twice as high as reported.		

What does the concept of ""excess deaths"" refer to in the context of COVID-19?		
- Measuring excess deaths allows us to understand the full impact of COVID-19 on mortality, including deaths indirectly related to COVID-19.		

What is the possible reason for the observed excess deaths in the US in 2020 that were not directly attributed to COVID-19?		
additional excess deaths, not directly attributed to COVID-19, may be due to underreporting in the early phases of the

124,PTFE Sprayed On Blue Masks Causes Symptoms Similar To COVID-19,"What symptoms can be caused by exposure to heated PTFE particles?		
The respiratory effects of PTFE are usually focused on acute toxicity. Heated PTFE particles may cause symptoms that range from mild flu-like symptoms to severe symptoms, such as pulmonary edema [11, 12].		

Can inhaling PTFE fumes cause flu-like symptoms?		
Numerous case studies in the 1900s have documented flu-like symptoms after inhalation of PTFE fumes by workers in PTFE-using factories and by people overheating non-stick pans in the kitchen.		

What health hazards associated with PTFE are mentioned in the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS)?		
Review of the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) showed that the lubricant contained polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) compounds, and warned smokers about the health hazards associated with the contamination of cigarettes with PTFE.		

Is there a link between short-term exposure to PTFE fumes and symptoms similar to COVID-19?		
These cases of Teflon flu are due to acute (short-term) exposures to PTFE fumes; no studies have been done looking at the long-term effects of brief, repeated PTFE-fume exposure, as would be the case in cooking using non-stick pans for a lifetime.		

Are PTFE and PFASs linked to serious health effects?

PTFE itself is not suspected of causing cancer, so says the American Cancer Society. That’s because PTFE is inert.		

What health effects can occur from long-term exposure to PTFE particles, such as those found in blue masks?		
This case demonstrates that long-term exposure to PTFE spraying can cause granulomatous lung lesions such as pneumoconiosis; such lesions appear to be caused not by the degradation products of PTFE from high temperatures but by spraying the particles of PTFE.		

Is PFOA, a chemical used in the manufacturing process of PTFE, considered potentially carcinogenic by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?		
This is a synthetic chemical that was used in small amounts to create PTFE. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is investigating whether PFOA is carcinogenic, as there have been health and environmental concerns over the manufacturing process of PTFE and chemicals such as PFOA that are used to make it.		

What are the potential health risks associated with exposure to PTFE, particularly in relation to respiratory health?		
Furthermore, no time-weighted average or short-term exposure limit is suggested for PTFE. Acute and chronic pulmonary diseases caused by PTFE have been reported, and further studies should be conducted to recognize toxicity and establish an exposure limit for PTFE.		

Can exposure to PTFE sprayed on masks cause lung toxicity and foreign body reactions similar to symptoms associated with COVID-19?		
Acute lung toxicity from PTFE fumes and chronic foreign body reactions from injected PTFE have been reported.

126,"Ulysses S. Grant, commander of the Union Army during the American Civil War, was a slave owner.","Did Ulysses S. Grant personally own slaves during his lifetime?		
As a result, Ulysses Grant was the last U.S. president to have owned an enslaved individual. Grant’s legacy as the respected Commanding General of the Union Army, and his efforts as president to protect black citizenship have long obscured his personal slave-ownership, as well as that of his beloved wife.		

When did Ulysses S. Grant free his slave, William Jones?		
At some time before the Civil War, Grant himself owned a slave named William Jones. We know this not because the Grant correspondence mentions it, as his letters up until the Civil War do not mention his opinions on slavery nor discuss the status of slaves, but because he manumitted Jones on March 29, 1859.		

Did Ulysses S. Grant initially prioritize the abolition of slavery as a goal of the American Civil War?		
Grant’s father, Jesse, was staunchly anti-slavery, but early in the Civil War Ulysses Grant asserted in a letter to his father that the main goal of the war was to restore the Union.		

Did Ulysses S. Grant actually own slaves, according to the historical record?		
The proponents of the myth that Ulysses S. Grant owned slaves during the War do so to obscure the historical record that the overwhelming reason given by southerners for seceding from the Union was to protect the institution of slavery, an institution that had expanded beyond southern borders.		

How did Ulysses S. Grant acquire a slave?		
Grant came to own that slave through his wife’s family. When Ulysses Grant and Julia Dent married on August 22, 1848, Grant was pursuing a military career, having recently returned from the Mexican-American War.		

How many slaves did Ulysses S. Grant own in his lifetime?		
The perhaps surprising answer is Ulysses S. Grant. As far as is known, Grant owned only one slave in his lifetime, and he freed that slave even though at the time Grant was in a dire financial situation and could have made some much needed money by selling his slave.		

Did Ulysses S. Grant have a clear stance against slavery before and during the American Civil War?		
Grant’s father, Jesse, was firmly anti-slavery. However, his son’s attitudes toward slavery were more ambivalent, at least from what we can discern of his opinions before and during the Civil War.		

Did Ulysses S. Grant own slaves during the American Civil War?		
The claim that Robert E. Lee did not own slaves is often paired with the claim that Ulysses S. Grant did own slaves during the Civil War.		

Did Ulysses S. Grant own slaves before the abolition of slavery?		
The last president who ever owned slaves was, ironically, Ulysses S. Grant, elected in 1868 after he had commanded Union forces to victory over the Confederacy in the war that led to the abolition of slavery.		

Did Ulysses S. Grant ever own slaves?		
While Grant’s views on slavery evolved over time, his relationship with slavery was complicated and demonstrates the pervasiveness of the institution in antebellum America.

135,No one lost their health care because of the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill.,"Did the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill lead to an increase in health care premiums in Iowa?		
Iowa’s Farm Bureau statute is making a bad situation worse for the state’s individual market. Thanks to a number of decisions by state policymakers and the dominant insurance company – Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield – premiums in the state’s individual market are already among the highest in the country, with an average annual marketplace plan premium in excess of $10,000 in 2018.		

Did the Iowa legislators approve a plan that allows Wellmark to sell health insurance policies that do not comply with Affordable Care Act regulations or state rules?

The bill was merged last week with another proposal that would allow the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation to work with Wellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield to sell health insurance plans that don't comply with the federal Affordable Care Act to its own members.		

Does the Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill exempt the plan from state and ACA regulations?		
The Iowa Farm Bureau partnered with Wellmark (Blue Cross) on a new self-funded benefit plan. The state’s legislation requires that the health plan be sponsored by a local nonprofit agriculture organization and explicitly defines the plan as “not insurance,” exempting the plan from most state insurance regulation as well as regulation required under the ACA.

137,it is unknown whether a person under 20 can pass the disease to an older adult.,"Is there an age gradient in terms of transmission risk from children to adults?		
There is new evidence, including from a recent comprehensive study from South Korea, suggesting there is an age gradient in terms of transmission risk from children, meaning younger children (<10 years old) are less likely to transmit compared to adults, while older children (10 and older) may transmit at levels similar to adults.		

Can children under the age of 20 transmit COVID-19 to older adults?		
Researchers in South Korea have found that children between the ages of 10 and 19 can transmit Covid-19 within a household just as much as adults, according to new research published in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.		

Can people under 20 years old transmit COVID-19 to older adults?		
Although children and young adults are reportedly at lower risk for severe disease and death from infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), than are persons in other age groups (1), younger persons can experience infection and subsequently transmit infection to those at higher risk for severe illness (2–4).		

Can children under 20 years old transmit the disease to adults?		
Without a doubt transmission from child-to-child and child-to-adult can occur, but a number of studies find children, particularly young children, are less likely to be source of infection in households and other settings, compared to adults.		

Can people under the age of 20 transmit the disease to older adults?		
Given the role of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission (2), all persons, including young adults, should take extra precautions to avoid transmission to family and community members who are older or who have underlying medical conditions.		

Can people under the age of 20 potentially pass COVID-19 to older adults, despite being at a lower risk of infection themselves?		
Evidence so far indicates that children are at a lower risk of infection, present with milder symptoms, and are much less likely to die from the infection compared to older adults, but they still could present a risk to others in their household, especially in households with people at higher risk, such as older adults and others with pre-existing conditions.		

Can a person under 20 years old pass COVID-19 to an older adult?		
Because persons with asymptomatic and mild disease, including children, are likely playing a role in transmission and spread of COVID-19 in the community, social distancing and everyday preventive behaviors are recommended for persons of all ages to slow the spread of the virus, protect the health care system from being overloaded, and protect older adults and persons of any age with serious underlying medical conditions.		

Is there a difference in the likelihood of transmission of the disease from children under 20 to older adults compared to adults aged 20-39?		
One large contact tracing study out of South Korea, published on July 16, found that kids 9 years old and younger were less likely to transmit the virus within households than older children, but were similar to adults ages 20-39.		

Does the lower susceptibility of children to SARS-CoV-2 infection imply that they are unable to pass the disease to older adults?		
Preliminary evidence suggests that children have a lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with adults, but the role that children and adolescents play in transmission of this virus remains unclear.		

Do epidemiological and modeling studies suggest that older children are more likely to drive transmission of the disease to other age groups?		
Epidemiological and modeling studies of transmission focused on households and daycare centers suggest that toddlers and older children, rather than infants, drive transmission in the population (11–14).

139,A campaign ad video for John Cornyn says that his plan would guarantee insurers must sell plans to any patient with preexisting conditions and will be covered in his plan.,"Does John Cornyn's plan align with the views of the majority of Americans regarding pre-existing conditions?		
A majority of Americans favor retaining the provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that prohibit insurers from denying coverage or charging more to people with preexisting health conditions.1 In fact, a proposed Senate bill, the Republican-backed Ensuring Coverage for Patients with Pre-Existing Conditions Act, would maintain certain provisions under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that prevent insurers from refusing coverage to people or varying premiums based on whether they have a preexisting condition.2		

How does John Cornyn's plan compare to the current Republican legislative proposal regarding coverage for pre-existing conditions?		
- Issue: A current Republican legislative proposal would permit insurers to offer plans that exclude coverage of treatment for preexisting health conditions, even while the bill would maintain the Affordable Care Act’s rule prohibiting denial of coverage to people with a preexisting condition.		

What specific health conditions would be covered under John Cornyn's plan?		
While the Ensuring Coverage for Patients with Pre-Existing Conditions Act maintains the ACA’s provisions that require insurers to enroll individuals with preexisting conditions, the proposed bill would not require that the conditions themselves be covered.		

How does John Cornyn's plan differ from the Affordable Care Act in terms of coverage for pre-existing conditions?		
However, in contrast with the ACA, the proposed legislation would permit insurers to sell plans that entirely exclude coverage for treatment of an enrolled individual’s preexisting condition (Exhibit 1).3 Prior to the ACA’s implementation in 2014, plans sold in the individual market often incorporated such coverage exclusions.4		

Does John Cornyn's plan align with Donald Trump's previous stance on protecting people with pre-existing medical conditions?		
President Trump’s record includes support for legislation to repeal and replace the ACA that would have weakened pre-existing condition protections, and expansion of short-term insurance plans that are not required to cover pre-existing conditions.		

Does John Cornyn's plan guarantee that insurers must sell plans to any patient with pre-existing conditions at the same price as those without pre-existing conditions?		
Similar to the House-passed bill (the American Health Care Act), the Cassidy-Graham bill would provide states expansive waiver authority to eliminate or weaken the prohibition against insurance companies charging higher premiums based on their health status and the requirement that insurers cover the essential health benefits related to any health insurance plan that is in any way subsidized by the bill’s block grant funding.		

Does John Cornyn's plan guarantee that insurers must sell plans to any patient with pre-existing conditions?		
TO YOUR HEALTH: Texas Sen. John Cornyn accused Democrats on Twitter Monday of not joining Republicans in the fight to guarantee coverage of pre-existing conditions even though Cornyn is one of the senators who voted to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act in 2017.		

How would John Cornyn's plan protect patients with pre-existing conditions?		
This bill would prevent insurers from refusing or varying premiums based on preexisting conditions. But, unlike the ACA, this bill would allow insurers to sell plans that entirely exclude coverage for care pertaining to the preexisting conditions themselves.		

Does John Cornyn's plan guarantee that insurers will sell plans to any patient with pre-existing conditions at an affordable rate?		
Senator Cassidy promised earlier than any final health bill would provide protection for individuals with pre-existing conditions, but Senator Collins has said that her reading of this bill is that it would allow for higher, possibly unaffordable rate increases for persons with pre-existing conditions.		

Does John Cornyn's plan guarantee that people with pre-existing conditions will be able to purchase health insurance?

200,Other Countries Have Proved that the U.S. FDA Was Wrong to Withdraw Approval Of Hydroxychloroquine as COVID Drug,"Have other countries found hydroxychloroquine to be an effective treatment for COVID-19?		
Research into finding an effective treatment for COVID-19 has continued unabated. Although some observational studies showed early promise with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, subsequent randomized trials revealed the lack of clinical benefit on these drugs.7,8 The discontinuation of the major trials on hydroxychloroquine—recovery9 and solidarity10—further strengthens the notion that it may not be effective, especially in severe COVID-19 cases.		

Did the results of the RECOVERY trial and the New England Journal of Medicine publication contradict the U.S. FDA's decision to withdraw approval of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 drug?		
- The MHRA took into consideration the results released from the RECOVERY trial, showing no beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalised with COVID-19, and a New England Journal of Medicine publication using hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis of COVID-19, concluding that hydroxychloroquine did not prevent illness compatible with Covid-19 or confirmed infection.		

Have other studies found any evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment?		
Other studies have also raised questions about using hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19, and the French study that first led to its widespread use against the disease has been roundly criticized as sloppy and misleading.		

Did the FDA's decision to withdraw approval of Hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 drug contradict the treatment protocols of other countries?

FDA soon took pains to reemphasize the limitations of this EUA, warning of serious heart rhythm problems in patients with COVID-19 treated with the drugs.39 A recent study published in The Lancet, which found that CQ and HCQ were associated with higher mortality and did not improve outcomes, was subsequently retracted after questions arose about the reliability of the data used in its analysis.40 This revocation prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to reinitiate a hydroxychloroquine investigation that had been suspended following the Lancet study’s initial publication.		

Do the results of the new studies contradict the claim that other countries have proved the U.S. FDA was wrong to withdraw approval of Hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 drug?

236,"Covid 19 Will Go Away If You Stop Getting Tested, It's Just The Elderly Dying and People Are Being Intentionally Infected","Did Donald Trump suggest that COVID-19 cases would decrease if testing was slowed down?		
Similarly, despite public health officials unanimously endorsing the need for widespread COVID-19 testing to contain the spread of the virus, Trump blamed testing itself for the rapidly rising number of COVID-19 cases and stated at a campaign rally that he told officials to “slow the testing down, please.”		

Is the claim that COVID-19 will go away if people stop getting tested supported by the fact that many cases are asymptomatic and not all infected individuals are being detected through testing?		
Considering that a large number of cases are asymptomatic (or present with very mild symptoms) and that testing has not been performed on the entire population, only a fraction of the SARS-CoV-2 infected population is detected, confirmed through a laboratory test, and officially reported as a COVID-19 case.		

Is it true that the number of Covid-19 cases is being artificially inflated due to insufficient testing capacity?		
Furthermore, the still-insufficient testing capacity for COVID-19 in China means that many suspected and clinically diagnosed cases are not yet counted in the denominator.2 This uncertainty in the CFR may be reflected by the important difference between the CFR in Hubei (2.9%) compared with outside Hubei (0.4%).1,2 Nevertheless, all CFRs still need to be interpreted with caution and more research is required.		

How does the claim that COVID-19 will go away if people stop getting tested relate to the evidence that testing, particularly of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals, is key to interrupting the spread of COVID-19?		
Therefore, COVID-19 can spread quickly in these communities, and the impact of that spread is great. Testing, particularly of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals, is key to interrupting this spread.		

Is it true that the elderly are at a higher risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19?		
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic (2). Data from China have indicated that older adults, particularly those with serious underlying health conditions, are at higher risk for severe COVID-19–associated illness and death than are younger persons (3).		

Are people who test positive for COVID-19 more likely to die if they are elderly?		
While we have much to learn yet about the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2, and the COVID-19 disease it causes, evidence to date suggests that deaths among people who have tested positive for the coronavirus are highest at older ages and near zero for young children.		

Is the reported number of Covid-19 cases and deaths accurate, or are there other factors contributing to the reported numbers?		
Miscounting from misdiagnosis or under-reporting of Covid-19-related deaths is avoided. Excess mortality data include ‘collateral damage’ from other health conditions, left untreated if the health system is overwhelmed by Covid-19 cases, or by deliberate actions that prioritise patients with Covid-19 over those with other symptoms.		

According to the CDC, can individuals with COVID-19, even those who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic, transmit the virus to others?		
Although scientists and health care professionals continue to study the spread of COVID-19 to learn more about its presentation, transmission and immunity, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that “a significant portion of individuals with [COVID-19] lack symptoms (“asymptomatic”) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (“pre-symptomatic”) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms.”		

Is it true that the majority of COVID-19 deaths are among the elderly and those with underlying health conditions?		
Early data from China suggest that a majority of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths have occurred among adults aged ≥60 years and among persons with serious underlying health conditions.		

How does the COVID-19 virus spread from one person to another?		
On average, someone with the COVID-19 virus is thought to infect two or more other people.7,8 This high infectivity rate and environmental stability of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen necessitates testing to identify infected individuals.

Did the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) enable and manage the illegal trafficking of Cuban medical professionals?

What were the conditions set by Cuba's Health Ministry regarding the participation of Cuban doctors in the 'More Doctors' program?

What were the concerns of the United States regarding Cuba's cooperation with the Pan American Health Organization?		
The Cuban government and the Pan American Health Organization protested the policy as a form of poaching that undermined Cuba’s health system and impeded newfound cooperation between the US and Cuba.

241,President Joe Biden is abusing the prescription drug Adderall.,"Is there any evidence that President Joe Biden is using Adderall?		
The president’s ridiculous claims, which he’s used to demand that Biden take a drug test before the debates, were given an air of legitimacy Monday night by Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel, who wildly speculated that the former vice president is using speed and Adderall.		

What is the claim that some people have made about President Joe Biden's use of Adderall?		
Some have accused the president of snorting Adderall, a stimulant used to enhance focus or treat attention issues.		

Is President Joe Biden being prescribed Adderall?		
Another author of the study, Dr. Ramin Mojtabai, backed up Dr. Chen, saying that the medical industry needs to treat Adderall like they treat prescription painkillers and that doctors need to enter the drug into Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs every time it is prescribed.		

Is President Joe Biden's age group (18-25) among the age groups most likely to misuse Adderall, and if so, how does his age group compare to the age group most likely to misuse the medication?		
The study, published today in The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, found that Adderall misuse is highest among 18- to 25-year-olds, who are primarily getting the medication from friends or family members and without a doctor's recommendation or prescription.		

Is President Joe Biden using Adderall for medical reasons or for non-medical purposes?		
The abuse of Adderall, or Adderall use disorder, refers to a pattern of behavior in which individuals use Adderall for reasons that are not medical in nature.		

Is there a high rate of misuse of the prescription drug Adderall among medical students?		
The prevalence of prescription stimulant misuse in medical students is also high. In fact, discussion based websites such as Facebook, Medical School Forum, and The Student Doctor Network are rife with Adderall “experts” and informal question-and-answer sessions on the drug.		

What is the potential use of Adderall, a prescription drug?		
Adderall is in wide use in the U.S., both for legitimate and illegitimate purposes. A prescription stimulant, the drug is just as likely to be abused for its focus-boosting qualities as it is used based on doctors’ orders.		

What claims did Rudy Giuliani make about President Joe Biden's health?		
4. Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani has made baseless health claims about Biden. Giuliani falsely said Biden, who stutters, has dementia and takes Adderall.		

Is there any evidence that President Joe Biden is using Adderall?		
Of the available treatments for ADHD, Adderall is widely prescribed. Despite its widespread use, there are no published data regarding the expected amphetamine excretion profile following its use.		

Is President Joe Biden taking Adderall for ADHD or for non-medical purposes?		
When taken exactly as prescribed by someone who has ADHD, Adderall can be helpful. However, the prescription of Adderall to adults who claim to have symptoms of ADHD as well as the non-medical use of Adderall has skyrocketed recently, as the drug has become well-known as a ‘study aid’ due to its ability to keep people awake and focused for long hours.

242,"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention downgrades COVID-19, rating it less fatal than seasonal flu","What is the estimated mortality ratio of COVID-19 based on existing data?		
Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality will take some time to fully understand, existing data suggest that the mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of reported cases) is between 3-4%.		

How many times more deaths from COVID-19 were reported than from the flu during the week ending April 11, 2020?		
The CDC also publishes provisional counts of COVID-19 deaths but acknowledges that its reporting lags behind other public data sources.7 For the week ending April 11, 2020, data indicate that the number of provisionally reported COVID-19 deaths was 14.4-fold greater than influenza deaths during the apparent peak week of the current season (week ending February 29, 2020), consistent with the ranges based on CDC statistics.6 As the CDC continues to revise its COVID-19 counts to account for delays in reporting, the ratio of counted COVID-19 deaths to influenza deaths is likely to increase.		

Is the death rate of COVID-19 lower than that of the seasonal flu, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention?		
It is true that the CDC has reported the possibility of a 0.2% death rate for the coronavirus. More specifically, the CDC in its ""Pandemic Planning Scenarios"" document estimated the death rate was about 0.26%, a number calculated by combining the CDC estimates for the death rate for symptomatic cases and the number of infected people who have no symptoms.		

Does the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's assessment of COVID-19 contradict the research from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention?		
The coronavirus is more fatal than the flu across all age ranges, but especially among older people, according to research from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention published in mid-February.		

What information did the CDC include in their COVID-19 data due to the ongoing pandemic?		
to influenza. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, CDC included total deaths from COVID-19 by age group to the		

Is the COVID-19 mortality rate as reported by the WHO actually indicating that it is less fatal than the seasonal flu, as claimed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention?		
Based on the WHO's most recent mortality rate of 3.4%, the COVID-19 outbreak is shaping up to be at least 34 times deadlier than the flu, which has a mortality rate of about 0.1% and kills 290,000 to 650,000 people per year across the globe.		

Does the CDC's estimate of COVID-19 fatalities exceed the estimated number of flu deaths in the US?		
(During the current flu season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there have been 39 million to 56 million flu illnesses and 24,000 to 62,000 flu deaths in the U.S., although that number is an estimate based on hospitalizations with flu symptoms, not based on actually counting up every person who has died of flu.)		

Is the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention comparing the fatality rates of COVID-19 and the seasonal flu?		
Hence, comparing the CFRs of COVID-19 and the seasonal flu without considering these differences is inappropriate.		

What is the case-fatality ratio for COVID-19 in the United States according to the current reports?		
The case-fatality ratio shows the proportion of deaths among people with confirmed COVID-19. Current reports show that in the United States, the case-fatality ratio is 5.9%.		

Is the COVID-19 virus considered to be less fatal than the seasonal flu according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention?

243,Eating millets will protect you from Coronavirus.,"Does the evidence suggest that eating millets can prevent or cure Coronavirus?		
Millets are known to contain numerous flavonoids with potential anti-viral properties. However, their anti-viral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be studied.		

What health benefits of millets are claimed to be beneficial for the human body?		
Millets provide protection against obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Though millets possess various health benefits, the anti-nutrients present in millets weaken the absorption of nutrients.		

Can eating millets or any other food prevent the transmission of COVID-19?		
According to EFSA, there is currently no evidence that COVID-19 is transmitted through eating food. However, good food safety practices are important to minimise the risk of foodborne illnesses.		

What health benefits, if any, have been found to be associated with eating millets?		
Millets can also protect genetic and epigenetic damage and enhance microbiome which may be the additional mechanism for beneficial effects of such diet, against CVDs and diabetes as well as cancers.27,28 Finally, our study, also found that this millet based intervention diet caused a significant increase in serum iron and haemoglobin and calcium indicating that it can be beneficial in combating under nutrition in females and possibly osteoporosis in both genders (Table 5).29,30		

Does eating millets have any proven effect in preventing the spread of Coronavirus?		
We have previously busted myths about food and immunity. A forwarded message has been taking advantage of the situation and is going viral on social media with the claim that “eating millets can prevent you from getting coronavirus”.		

Do the antioxidative properties of millets, which have been shown to protect against cardiovascular diseases, have any potential benefits in protecting against Coronavirus?		
For example, millets have antioxidative properties due to the presence of phenolic compounds, which have been shown to protect against cardiovascular diseases (Kumari et al. 2019).		

Does eating millets have any proven benefits in protecting against COVID-19?		
No. There is no evidence that eating garlic has protected people from COVID-19. However, garlic is a food that may have some antimicrobial properties.		

Does eating millets have any proven effect on preventing COVID-19?		
There is no single food that will prevent you from catching COVID-19. For more information on a healthy diet, see the Healthy diet fact sheet.		

Is there any evidence to support the claim that eating millets can protect against COVID-19?		
No supplement will cure or prevent disease, and no supplement or diet can protect you from COVID-19. Currently, no research supports the use of any supplement to protect against COVID-19 specifically.		

Does eating millets have any proven benefits in protecting against COVID-19?		
No. There is no evidence that eating ginger has protected people from COVID-19. However, ginger is a food that may have some antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.

244,Claims that there were links between Trumps 2016 election campaign and Russia were part of a hoax that Hilary Clinton was behind.,"Who or what entity initiated the investigation into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government in 2016?		
- The Russia investigation was not a hoax, and it did not originate from Democrats or the media. The investigation began in July 2016 after the FBI received a tip about potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.		

What was the initial reason for the FBI's investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 election?		
The allegation that Russia stole Democratic Party emails from Hillary Clinton, John Podesta and others and then passed them to WikiLeaks helped trigger the FBI's probe into now debunked claims of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to steal the 2016 election.		

Does the evidence provided suggest that Hillary Clinton was involved in a hoax to create claims of links between Trump's 2016 election campaign and Russia?		
Below, we unpack the basis for the claim — which refers to a years-long investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election — as well as bipartisan congressional reports and federal records that found no evidence that Obama, or his Democratic allies, illegally launched surveillance efforts.		

What evidence does the Mueller report provide regarding the Russian government's interference in the 2016 presidential election?		
Although Mueller did not find evidence amounting to a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Moscow, the report makes clear that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election “in a sweeping and systematic fashion”.		

Did the Mueller Report find any evidence of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election?		
The Mueller report concludes that the Trump campaign didn't criminally conspire with Russia during the 2016 election, but there were plenty of contacts between people in Trump's orbit and Russians.		

Did the Mueller report support the claim that there were no links between Trump's 2016 election campaign and Russia?		
The Mueller report writes that the investigation ""identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign"", found that Russia ""perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency"" and that the 2016 Trump presidential campaign ""expected it would benefit electorally"" from Russian hacking efforts.		

Did the Special Counsel's report support the claim that there were no links between Trump's 2016 election campaign and Russia?		
The Special Counsel's report, made public in April 2019, examined numerous contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials but concluded that, though the Trump campaign welcomed the Russian activities and expected to benefit from them, there was insufficient evidence to bring any conspiracy or coordination charges against Trump or his associates.		

What were the outcomes of the investigation into the alleged links between Trump's 2016 election campaign and Russia?		
While those links did not ultimately substantiate a criminal charge of conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, the investigation yielded two lengthy indictments of Russian nationals and officials for their interference in the 2016 election as well as six Trump associates: Roger Stone, Michael Flynn, Michael Cohen, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, and George Papadopoulos.[60]		

What was the reason for the FBI and the Justice Department to launch their investigation into the 2016 campaign?		
The 434-page report by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz concluded that the FBI and the Justice Department launched their investigation into the 2016 campaign not for political reasons, but because of evidence the Russian government was using cutouts to reach out to the Trump campaign as part of its efforts to influence the election.		

Did Robert Mueller's investigation find evidence of a conspiracy between Trump's 2016 election campaign and Russia?		
Special counsel Robert Mueller's redacted report into the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election didn't find sufficient evidence to charge anyone involved in President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign with conspiracy to influence the election.

What types of voter irregularities did the campaign cite in New Jersey, including instances in the 2020 primary?		
The campaign cited several examples of voter fraud in the state from the 1980s to the 2020 primary, including dozens of instances in June of voters receiving multiple ballots in the mail, voting more than once, or improperly sending back their mail-in ballots.		

Were there any instances of voter fraud in the 2020 U.S Presidential Election in New Jersey?		
Both Barr and Trump have pointed specifically to reports of alleged fraud in a special election in Paterson, New Jersey, this past May, where several city officials have faced voter fraud charges and the county elections board rejected nearly 20 percent of mail-in ballots submitted.		

What types of ballots are most vulnerable to being altered, stolen, or forged?		
Mail-in ballots are the ballots most vulnerable to being altered, stolen, or forged. Just look at the current investigation going on in Paterson, New Jersey, over a recent municipal election conducted entirely by mail.		

Did a forensic report find any evidence of voter fraud in Mercer County, New Jersey, related to mail-in ballots being sent to a man's deceased parents in the 2020 U.S Presidential Election?		
Overall, the county received 3,100 mail-in ballots. The forensic report concluded there was no evidence of voter fraud, Kantz said.		

Did President Donald Trump claim that mail-in voting is prone to fraud?		
Critics, including President Donald Trump, have claimed that mail-in voting is prone to fraud and that the increase in vote-by-mail undermines the integrity of the state’s election results.		

Were any mail-in ballots sent to a man's deceased parents in Mercer County in New Jersey rejected in the 2020 U.S Presidential Election?		
The Passaic County Board of Elections rejected 3,190 ballots, about 19% of the mail-in ballots submitted, for the May 12 election in Paterson, but it is unclear how many were connected to the fraud allegations.		

Does Mercer County in New Jersey verify the status of mail-in voters who cast their ballots in person after receiving a mail-in ballot?		
In addition, as to mail-in ballots issued less than seven days prior to an election, the county board of elections shall also check to establish that the mail-in voter did not vote in person.		

What was the reason for the 222 uncounted ballots in the 2020 U.S Presidential Election in Mercer County, New Jersey?		
Another large chunk of uncounted ballots, 222, were due to mismatches between the signatures on the mail-in ballot and the ones on the voter's original voter registration application.		

What types of issues were identified with the absentee ballots in Mercer County, New Jersey?		
Among the absentee ballots, she identified ballots issued to individuals who were not residents of the district, improprieties in the completion of the certifications by the voter, irregularities in delivery of the ballots, missing certification flaps on the inner ballot envelopes, and absentee ballots with signatures of the voter that did not match the signature in the official register of voters.

276,"Due to coronavirus schools and colleges have been closed and because of this, the education of students has been affected. The government is providing free laptops to all the students so that they can complete their education and also give exams with the help of the internet","Is the government's plan to provide free laptops to students sufficient to address the digital divide in K-12 schools caused by the closure of schools due to the coronavirus?		
In fact, the coronavirus has exposed the digital divide that exists in K-12 schools. In response, many urban districts are scrambling to purchase digital learning devices such as Chromebooks and iPads so that students without those technologies are not left behind.		

How has the government's provision of free laptops to students addressed the challenges of unequal access to digital tools and connectivity during the COVID-19 pandemic?		
Unequal access to digital tools, connectivity and lack of training has imposed unseen challenges for governments, schools and teachers to engage students in long distance education during the COVID-19 pandemic.		

Does the US government believe that schools have a responsibility to provide laptops or tablets to all students during the coronavirus outbreak?		
When asked about schools’ responsibility to provide laptop or tablet computers to students in order to help them complete their schoolwork at home during the coronavirus outbreak, 37% of Americans say K-12 schools have this responsibility to all students, and 43% say they are only responsible for providing these resources to students whose families cannot afford them.		

How have the government's efforts to provide free laptops to students been affected by the lack of access to home computers and high-speed internet in many families?		
Few school districts have experience providing wide-scale educational services online for all students, and not all families have access to home computers and high-speed internet to take advantage of such online options.		

Is the government's plan to provide free laptops to students sufficient to support students in completing their education during the school closures due to the coronavirus?		
Governments should focus on adopting strategies that support all students through closures – for example, monitoring students most at risk and ensuring students receive printed or online materials on time, with particular attention provided to students with disabilities who may require adapted, accessible material.		

How is the government's provision of free laptops to students helping to mitigate the impact of school closures on their education?

Is the government's plan to provide free laptops to students sufficient to ensure that all students can complete their education and give exams during the school closures due to the coronavirus?

Not all students are set up for online learning, and students who are poor have less access to key tools: Share of eighth-graders with access to online learning, by income level and tool, 2017		

How does the government's provision of free laptops to students address the issue of unequal access to remote learning resources, particularly for low-income students?		
Learning loss will probably be greatest among low-income, black, and Hispanic students. Lower-income students are less likely to have access to high-quality remote learning or to a conducive learning environment, such as a quiet space with minimal distractions, devices they do not need to share, high-speed internet, and parental academic supervision.11 Data from Curriculum Associates, creators of the i-Ready digital-instruction and -assessment software, suggest that only 60 percent of low-income students are regularly logging into online instruction; 90 percent of high-income students do.

All tests can provide at least some false results.

The Senate bill would eliminate the tax exemption for professional all sports leagues. Since 1966, U.S. tax law has specifically exempted professional football leagues from tax under section 501(c)(6); the IRS has historically applied this exemption to all professional sports leagues.		

Why do some people dispute the tax-exempt status of the NFL and other sports leagues?		
Over the years, sports leagues have faced opposition to their 501(c)(6) tax exemptions. For example, opponents disputed the National Football League's (NFL) nonprofit status due to the league's high executive salaries and large revenues.		

Which of the three major American sports leagues, the NFL, NBA, and MLB, currently have tax-exempt status?		
While the major league organizations for soccer and football enjoy some degree of tax exempt status, the National Basketball Association (NBA) has never been tax exempt and Major League Baseball (MLB) gave up its exemption in 2007.		

Does Section 501(c)(6) of the IRS code specifically exempt professional sports leagues, such as the NFL, from paying taxes?		
Some critics have maintained that the NFL (and the NFL alone, not other sports leagues) was tax-exempt due to a special ""loophole"" inserted into the tax code in 1966, referencing Section 501(c)(6) of the IRS code, a section that specifically includes ""Professional football leagues"" along with ""business leagues, chambers of commerce, real-estate boards, or boards of trade"" as tax-exempt organizations.

What type of tax-exempt status does the NFL have under the Internal Revenue Code?		
According to league spokesman Brian McCarthy, the NFL is organized as a trade or industry association that is exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code, not Section 501(c)(3), which exempts charitable organizations.		

Why do the NFL, NBA, and MLB have tax-exempt status?		
The reason the NFL doesn’t pay taxes is beyond outdated at this point. The league is a registered 501(c)(6), which “provides for exemption of business leagues, chambers of commerce, real estate boards, boards of trade, and professional football leagues.”		

What is the tax status of the NFL, NBA, and MLB?		
In addition to the NFL, the PGA Tour, NHL, and LPGA are recognized as nonprofit organizations. MLB voluntarily surrendered its tax-exempt status in 2007, and the NBA has always been a publicly for-profit organization.		

Why do the NFL, NBA, and MLB have tax-exempt status?		
All Section 501(c)(6) tax-exempt organizations are required to make certain disclosures annually, including information such as income and activities over the year.[14] Other professional sports leagues have abandoned their tax-exempt status to avoid disclosing the salaries of their top executives; this consequence may have tempted the NFL to do the same.[15]

Her confusion is understandable; media outlets often do present ""black lives matter"" and ""all lives matter"" as opposing slogans.

When I asked Garza about the most common misperception of Black Lives Matter, she pointed to a frequent social-media dig that it is “a gay movement masquerading as a black one.”		

What did Bubba Watson express confusion about in his post?		
Also, FactCheck.org points out that a number of groups use the phrase “Black Lives Matter” in their name.

Inevitably, there will be an investigation, along the lines of the 9/11 Commission, to look into the ramifications of the President’s denialism, the shortages in testing and medical equipment, and the dismissal of so many warning signs.		

What factors were considered when making decisions about COVID lockdowns?		
When major decisions (e.g. draconian lockdowns) are based on forecasts, the harms (in terms of health, economy, and society at large) and the asymmetry of risks need to be approached in a holistic fashion, considering the totality of the evidence.		

What was a key factor in the UK government's decision to start the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic?

This is false; experts agree that while the virus itself is small enough to fit through mask fibers -- as is vape smoke -- masks do help stop the much-larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles, and multiple studies have indicated that masks reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.		

Does wearing a face mask prevent the spread of coronavirus?		
With a surgical mask, coronavirus was not detected in either respiratory droplets or aerosols, suggesting that surgical masks may be effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19.		

Do face masks help prevent the spread of coronavirus?		
When it comes to controlling the spread of respiratory illnesses, face masks can help. A study from 2008 found that surgical masks were 68 percent effective in blocking the transmission of SARS, while N95 masks (a type of respirator mask that filters airborne particulate matter) were more than 90 percent effective.		

Does the video accurately represent the findings of scientific papers on the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19?		
A viral video misrepresents scientific papers and the reasons for wearing face masks to claim that they are ineffective in mitigating transmission of COVID-19.		

Do face masks made of surgical and dense cotton fabrics effectively prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 into the environment through coughing?		
The answer is highly relevant to guide public behaviour (Leung et al., 2020). One study suggests that a surgical face mask and masks made of dense cotton fabrics apparently cannot effectively prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 into the environment through the coughing of patients with COVID-19 (Bae et al., 2020; Klompas, Morris, Sinclair, Pearson, & Shenoy, 2020).		

Do face masks help prevent the spread of coronavirus?		
Surgical face masks may therefore be effective against COVID-19 transmission [17-19]. Thus, face masks can probably protect against virus infection by reducing the risk that virus enters the mouth or nose via respiratory droplets or aerosols.		

Does wearing a face mask in public places help prevent the spread of COVID-19?		
Face masks are a simple way to help decrease coronavirus transmission and save lives. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wearing a face mask in public places has been shown to reduce the spread of COVID-19, because those who are pre-symptomatic can spread the virus before showing symptoms.		

What is the current scientific consensus on the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19?		
Currently, the scientific consensus is that face masks are at least somewhat effective at preventing the spread of COVID-19, and both the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend wearing a cloth face covering.		

Does the available evidence support the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of coronavirus?		
First, the evidence for the effectiveness of face masks in reducing viral transmission is very weak. Few studies examine the use of face masks in community settings; those that do find no evidence of reduced transmission compared with no face masks.(2,3) Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence: both recent systematic reviews cautiously suggest that in some circumstances, wearing of face masks may be warranted.(2,3)		

Do face masks provide any protection against the spread of coronavirus?		
A few studies have considered the filtration efficiency of homemade masks made with different types of fabric;48–51 however, there is no broad consensus regarding their effectiveness in minimizing disease transmission.52,53 Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that masks and other face coverings are effective in stopping larger droplets, which, although fewer in number compared to the smaller droplets and nuclei, constitute a large fraction of the total volume of the ejected respiratory fluid.

COVID-19 and the flu are both respiratory illnesses caused by different viruses. While they share some symptoms like fever, cough and fatigue, COVID-19 causes more symptoms than the flu, including loss of taste or smell, shortness of breath and digestive issues.		

Does the World Health Organization believe that COVID-19 follows seasonal variations similar to the common cold and influenza?		
The Covid-19 pandemic is currently unfolding in “one big wave” with no evidence that it follows seasonal variations common to influenza and other coronaviruses, such as the common cold, the World Health Organization has warned.		

Does the COVID-19 pandemic overlap with the normal cold and flu season?		
COVID-19 syndromic surveillance is severely complicated by its similar presentation and overlapping timeframe with a variety of seasonal illnesses, such as the common cold, allergies, and influenza.		

Is there any indication that COVID-19 behaves like the common cold or flu in terms of seasonal patterns?		
It is possible that COVID-19 could turn out to be a seasonal illness, similar to influenza. However, experts warn that, at least for now, amid the ongoing pandemic, warmer weather is unlikely to drive the disease away.		

Is the increase in COVID-19 cases in the US related to the end of the flu season?		
In the US, the flu season is coming to an end, whereas COVID-19 numbers continue to rise. So, flulike symptoms should prompt concern for COVID-19.		

Can COVID-19 symptoms be mistaken for those of the common cold or flu during flu season?

Why can it be difficult to distinguish between COVID-19 and the common cold or flu based on symptoms alone?		
Seasonal coronaviruses should not be confused with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Because flu and the common cold have similar symptoms, it can be difficult to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone.

Did the World Health Organization initially recommend the use of face masks in areas of widespread COVID-19 transmission?		
Even the cautious and consensus-driven World Health Organization, which initially recommended against masks, now encourages their use in areas of widespread COVID-19 transmission137, in light of new information on the disease and the results of large-scale comparative studies135.		

Does the World Health Organization recommend the use of face masks for protection against COVID-19?		
Despite growing evidence on the value of masking and calls for public use of masks as part of a broader strategy that also includes social distancing and hand washing [, ], recent commentary suggests that public guidance on masks may be inconsistent across nations [ ], and the World Health Organization (WHO) maintains, as of May 2020, that masks are only needed for healthy individuals when they are taking care of someone with suspected COVID-19 [ ].		

Does the World Health Organization believe that wearing face masks protects the wearer from getting Covid-19?		
Wearing masks against COVID-19 is beneficial in suppressing pandemic spread, not through preventing the wearer from being infected but by preventing the wearer from infecting others, according to suggestions from the World Health Organization (WHO, 2020a,b,c) and lessons from previous pandemics, such as the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic and the 2009 influenza A virus subtype H1N1 pandemic (Mniszewski et al., 2014; Leung et al., 2020).

What does the World Health Organization's updated guidance on the use of masks for the control of COVID-19 say about the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19?		
WHO published updated guidance on the use of masks for the control of COVID-19, which provided updated advice on who should wear a mask, when it should be worn and what it should be made of.		

Does the WHO's statement about the lack of evidence for face masks protecting against Covid-19 refer to their effectiveness in the general community or in a medical setting?		
However, there is an essential distinction between absence of evidence and evidence of absence. Evidence that face masks can provide effective protection against respiratory infections in the community is scarce, as acknowledged in recommendations from the UK and Germany.7, 8 However, face masks are widely used by medical workers as part of droplet precautions when caring for patients with respiratory infections.

445,Masks lower immune systems.,"Does wearing a face mask have a negative impact on the immune system?		
The claim is misleading; wearing a face mask does not negatively impact the immune system, according to health experts; as of July 2020, international health authorities and governments around the world recommended wearing face masks as part of efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19.		

Does wearing a mask weaken the immune system?		
The idea that wearing face masks weakens the immune system is not supported by scientific evidence. This article published on The Conversation illustrates how wearing even a cloth face covering can help to limit the spread of COVID-19 by blocking infectious droplets, which is the main mode of disease transmission.		

Does wearing a mask have any negative impact on the immune system?		
Mask use does not weaken the ability of the immune system to fight infection. Instead, wearing a mask helps to keep your community safe by preventing the accidental spread of COVID-19 by people who are infected but do not show symptoms.		

Does wearing a face mask weaken the human immune system?		
There is no evidence that face masks weaken the immune system. Risks associated with wearing face masks only apply to a select few in the general population.		

Does wearing a mask have a negative effect on the immune system?		
International health authorities maintain that wearing a face mask is safe and can in fact protect the immune system from the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19.		

Does wearing masks weaken the human immune system?		
The claim that wearing masks would weaken the immune system is also unsupported by scientific evidence.		

Does wearing a mask weaken the human immune system?		
The American Lung Association also notes in this article debunking face masks conspiracy theories that “there is absolutely no scientific evidence that mask wearing or physical distancing weakens the immune system.”		

Is there any evidence that wearing masks can help reduce the spread of a coronavirus, such as SARS?		
Although researchers found no definitive clinical studies evaluating the effectiveness of masks to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, they did find evidence that facial coverings were associated with decreasing the spread of another coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.		

Does wearing a mask weaken the human immune system?		
There is no evidence that mask use weakens the immune system. We all have harmless types of bacteria living on the surface of our bodies, and evidence suggests that they might affect the way our immune systems behave, but wearing a mask does not make these bacteria go away.		

Does the available evidence support the claim that masks have a negative impact on the immune system?		
Overall, we found limited evidence regarding the effect of masks on viral respiratory infections both in the community and in health care settings, and most of our analyses showed no statistically significant differences.

446,"US President Trump made vaccines voluntary, not mandatory, in the US.","What authority does the President have to change the vaccination policy in the US?		
Mandating vaccination is a state power, not within the president’s jurisdiction. Trump will also lack the power to directly change the CDC’s recommended vaccination schedule, but he can appoint a new director to the CDC or the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.		

Did the Trump administration change the mandatory nature of vaccines in the US?		
The Trump administration has sought to control vaccine guidance issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) — a customarily apolitical scientific regulator tasked with certifying the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, medications, and other medical treatments and technologies.		

Did the Trump administration initially try to prevent the implementation of vaccine guidelines in the US?		
The Trump administration later attempted to block the vaccine guidelines but ultimately allowed their implementation after protests from experts and the biotech industry concerned about undermining public trust in the FDA.		

What was the impact of the Trump administration's decision to close down the National Vaccine Program Office on vaccine safety measures in the US?		
The Trump administration’s efforts to politicize and undermine vaccine safety measures are especially damaging given the administration’s 2019 decision to close down the National Vaccine Program Office — a government body tasked with monitoring the safety of vaccines.		

What level of government in the U.S. is responsible for determining vaccination policies?		
Vaccination policies occur at the national and state-levels in the U.S. In order to achieve 		

Did the US President Trump make a change in the policy of mandatory vaccination in the US?

Did the US government change the vaccination policy to make vaccines voluntary under the Trump administration?		
of mandatory vaccination or mandates for speciﬁc vaccines. In the latter case, 		

Did the change in vaccination policy from mandatory to voluntary under President Trump affect vaccination coverage in the US?		
Therefore, from the point of view of recent and ongoing debates about vaccine mandates, a centrally important question is the degree to which a particular mandatory vaccination policy impacts vaccination coverage compared to other possible policies, whether mandatory or nonmandatory.		

Did the US President Trump's administration change the vaccination policy from mandatory to voluntary?		
The first school vaccination requirements were enacted in the 1850s to prevent smallpox. Federal and state efforts to eradicate measles in the 1960s and 1970s motivated many modern mandates policies.

447,A virus can easily pass through a mask.,"Does the use of N95 respirators provide better protection than medical masks against viral respiratory infections?		
Respiratory viruses are primarily transmitted by large droplets. Because a fraction of respiratory viruses may be transmitted by aerosol, N95 respirators have been presumed to provide better protection than medical masks against viral respiratory infections in health care settings.2 However, definitive evidence of greater clinical effectiveness of N95 respirators is lacking.		

Can surgical masks be effective in preventing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2?		
A previous study reported that surgical masks and N95 masks were equally effective in preventing the dissemination of influenza virus (4), so surgical masks might help prevent transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS–CoV-2).		

How effective are face masks in preventing the spread of a virus?		
Yes. Face masks reduce the spread of viral respiratory infection. N95 respirators and surgical masks both provide substantial protection (compared with no mask), and surgical masks provide greater protection than cloth masks.		

Can a virus be effectively blocked by wearing a surgical mask?		
Surgical masks reduced the overall number of RNA copies by 3.4 fold. These results suggest an important role for aerosols in transmission of influenza virus and that surgical facemasks worn by infected persons are potentially an effective means of limiting the spread of influenza.		

What was the effect of wearing a surgical mask on the transmission of human coronaviruses, according to the study?		
An April study found that surgical masks reduced the transmission of multiple human coronaviruses (though the research did not include this new one, SARS-CoV-2) through both respiratory droplets and smaller aerosols.		

Does a mask prevent the transmission of a virus?		
Masks have been extensively studied for the role in preventing transmission of pathogenic particles.[47-56] Surgical masks prevent diseases transmitted through droplets, from the healthcare worker to the patient, or vice versa.[57,58]		

Are face masks effective in preventing the acquisition of the coronavirus?		
Evidence from previous studies suggests that even face masks with less than 95% FFE (eg, surgical masks) are effective in preventing acquisition of epidemic coronaviruses (ie, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1, SARS-CoV-2) by clinicians and other health care workers except possibly during aerosol-generating procedures.9-11 For prevention of a related coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1, N95 respirators had no increased prevention benefit over surgical masks.10		

Can a virus pass through a mask?		
Although surgical masks have lower filtration efficiency than N95 respirators, observational studies have shown no significant benefit of N95 masks over surgical masks for prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (odds ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.22-3.33) or other respiratory viruses (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.85-1.08).3 For health care workers, routine care for a patient with COVID-19 if both are wearing surgical masks is not considered to be a high-risk occupational exposure.3 Yet, SARS-CoV-2 viral particles have been identified in the air for several hours after an aerosolizing event simulated in a laboratory and near air vents in a clinical setting.3 A group of 239 scientists recently signed an open letter urging the World Health Organization and other international public health bodies to recommend additional precautions (though not N95 masks specifically) to protect against potential airborne transmission, highlighting several recent superspreading events in which SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurred in poorly ventilated areas.5 These instances raise concern for the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission; however, the viability and infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in aerosol form remains unknown.		

Does wearing a surgical mask prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2?		
Importantly, no documented SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks have been linked to settings in which surgical masks were assiduously used in lieu of N95 masks, which suggests that even if airborne transmission is a considerable contributor to SARS-CoV-2 transmission, surgical masks are likely sufficient to prevent it.3 Because the infectious dose of virus required to cause clinical infection also remains unknown, it is possible that blocking most, even if not all, viral particles through masks with lower filtration efficiencies of submicron particles is sufficient to prevent disease in the vast majority of cases.		

What is the effectiveness of different types of masks in preventing the transmission of viruses?		
A previous study showed that 2-ply cotton masks are ineffective in preventing respiratory viral infections (RVI) (2), while other studies have demonstrated efficacy of the medical masks in decreasing RVI (3, 4).

456,idol of goddess Kali was burnt in West bengals Murshidabad by the muslim community.,"What was the context in which the idol of goddess Kali was burnt in West Bengal's Murshidabad?		
The intense communal propaganda by the RSS, BJP, Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Bajrang Dal and Hindu Samhati over the Durga idol immersion restrictions, incited communal carnage throughout West Bengal last year during Muharram processions.		

What is the relationship between the Muslim community in Murshidabad and the rulers of the region during the early modern period?		
The representation of the goddess electing to bless the Muslim nawab is extremely significant. It underlines the strong possibility, borne out by other aspects of Bengals’ social and cultural history during the early modern period, that to a segment of Bengal's population, the nawabs of Murshidabad were not alien oppressors, but rather, their immediate ruler and someone who was doing his best to expel the external invaders.		

What is the potential concern of the government regarding the timing of Durga idol immersion and Muharram processions in West Bengal?		
The fear of a breakdown of communal harmony in West Bengal as the night of Bishorjan (Durga idol immersion) and the start of Muharram processions coincided, is very real for the government as both processions would be in public spaces, that is, the streets of Kolkata and in the districts.		

What is the reputation of the goddess Kali in the West?		
Kali's poor reputation in the West is often ascribed largely to the cult of the Thuggee, a group of indigenous South Asians (primarily centered near Kolkata, c. thirteenth-nineteenth century C.E.) who took the goddess Kali as their deity.		

What is the current state of communal harmony in West Bengal, according to the evidence?		
West Bengal, the state that was called the paradise of communal harmony, despite several shortcomings, has now become a paradise for the communal fascists and divisive forces due to the total failure of Mamata Banerjee and the TMC in strengthening social cohesion.

The Kali idol in the temple, was crafted in Calcutta as per Amma’s instructions. Mother Kali is the destroyer of the ego.		

Is there any evidence to support the claim that the idol of goddess Kali was burnt in West Bengal's Murshidabad by the Muslim community?		
In this context, Kali is considered the 'forceful' form of the great goddess Durga. Another account of the origins of Kali is found in the Matsya Purana, c. 1500 C.E., which states that she originated as a mountain tribal goddess in the north-central part of India, in the region of Mount Kalanjara (now known as Kalinjar).		

What historical events in Bengal during Ramprasad's time may have influenced the devotion to Kali in his songs?		
Ramprasad's songs are known as Ramprasadi.[39] The devotion to Kali often included as a background the events in Bengal during his time, such as the Bengal famine of 1770, economic hardships, and the deterioration of rural culture.

It is true that various sections of CRTC regulations prohibit the broadcasting of ""false or misleading news"" by radio and television licensees, and that in 2011 the CRTC declined to narrow those regulations to apply only to ""news that the licensee knows is false or misleading and that endangers or is likely to endanger the lives, health or safety of the public.""		

Is it a crime in Canada to spread false information on the radio?

In light of the protections afforded by section 2(b) of the Charter and the objectives set out in the Act, the Commission reminds the public that for the Commission to take action on a complaint relating to the broadcast of false or misleading news, the breach of the false or misleading news provisions must be flagrant.		

Does the Broadcasting Act in Canada have any provisions related to the content of programs broadcast on the airwaves?		
Given that broadcasters have a responsibility under section 3(1)(h) of the Broadcasting Act (the Act) for the programs they broadcast, and given that when the programs in question aired MSNBC Canada was subject to the Specialty Services Regulations, 1990 (the Regulations), the Commission considers that there is a need to address the complaints in order to provide guidance to the industry and the public on acceptable programming content standards, even though MSNBC Canada is no longer in operation.		

Does the Radio Act in Canada currently make it a crime to lie to the public via airwaves?		
But not apparently to the CRTC. It is proposing to soften the regulation, banning “any news that the licensee knows is false or misleading and that endangers or is likely to endanger the lives, health or safety of the public.”		

Does the CRTC have the authority to issue binding regulations regarding broadcasting in Canada?		
The regulations of the CRTC are legally binding; however, the CRTC also has within its legal mandate under the 1991 Broadcasting Act authority to ...issue guidelines and statements with respect to any matter within its jurisdiction under this Act, but no such guidelines or statements issued by the Commission are binding on the Commission (section 6).		

Does the Broadcasting Act require the CRTC to regulate and supervise the truthfulness of information broadcasted on the airwaves in Canada?

Is the high number of deaths resulting from police action in South Africa due to the implementation of the law providing for the use of deadly force or the high level of violent crime in the country?

Bruce indicates (at 156) that the year in which the number of deaths resulting from police shootings were the highest according to ICD statistics was also the year in which South Africa experienced its highest murder rates and the highest number of police killings, thereby implying that a likely reason for the high number of deaths as a result of police action is the high level of violent crime in South Africa and is not an outcome of the implementation of the law providing for the use of deadly force.

498,"As we speak the US are developing a growing number of treatments, including convalescent plasma, that are saving lives all across the country.","Have there been any randomized clinical trial data on the effectiveness of convalescent plasma in treating Covid-19?		
CNN notes that convalescent plasma has already been used in the treatment of more than 60,000 Covid-19 patients and while “promising signs” have resulted from some studies, “there is not yet randomized clinical trial data on convalescent plasma to treat Covid-19”.		

Has the effectiveness of convalescent plasma in treating COVID-19 been proven?		
The efficacy of convalescent plasma for treatment of COVID-19 has not yet been determined, and this report, focused on safety signals, should not be misconstrued as evidence of effectiveness.		

Does the effectiveness of convalescent plasma in treating COVID-19 depend on the amount of antibodies it contains?		
It's still unclear whether plasma treatments are effective for people with COVID-19. A recent non-peer-reviewed study posted online reported on more than 30,000 patients receiving convalescent plasma; it showed that the more antibodies there were in a particular batch of convalescent plasma, the more effective the plasma was in preventing death.		

Is the use of convalescent plasma effective in reducing mortality rates for COVID-19 patients?		
- While HHS continues to clinically evaluate efficacy data, a large Mayo Clinic study found that the use of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 is safe, and preliminary results suggest a lower mortality rate for COVID-19 patients when plasma is administered early in the disease course.		

What is the current status of the use of convalescent plasma in treating COVID-19?		
Although the use of convalescent plasma shows promise, the evidence supporting its use in the treatment of COVID-19 remains limited, and thus its use remains investigational.		

Has the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of convalescent plasma as a treatment for COVID-19?		
""Although promising, convalescent plasma has not yet been shown to be safe and effective as a treatment for COVID-19,"" the agency wrote.		

What type of treatment have researchers reported safety results from in a study involving 5000 adults with COVID-19?		
Since the recent Cochrane review that highlighted very low-certainty evidence on the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 patients [4], Joyner and colleagues have reported safety results from a compassionate use convalescent plasma therapy programme in 5000 adults with COVID-19.		

Does the available data support the safety and potential efficacy of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 treatment?		
This has led to calls for the wider adoption of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 (23). Nonetheless, while the data support safety and potential efficacy of convalescent plasma, randomized trials are needed (23).		

Is there any conclusive evidence that convalescent plasma is effective in treating Covid-19?		
There has been an inevitable lag between the onset of the pandemic and the availability of an effective therapy, and, as of today, no treatment has been convincingly shown to be effective.4-7 Previous data on the use of convalescent plasma during the SARS and MERS epidemics suggest that antibodies could be passively transferred to patients by administering specific antibodies contained in the plasma from recovered/convalescent subjects.8-16 A meta-analysis on the use of hyperimmune immunoglobulins in severe acute respiratory infections of viral etiology, published in 2014, concluded that the technique is effective and safe, although well-designed clinical trials were advocated.17 At the time of designing this study, there were very few studies in the literature demonstrating the feasibility and efficacy of hyperimmune plasma in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and all of them reported small case series.		

Is there sufficient evidence to support the use of convalescent plasma as a treatment for COVID-19 in the US?		
The National Institute of Health treatment guidelines, last updated on July 17, say there's ""insufficient data"" to support convalescent plasma as a Covid-19 treatment, though thousands of patients in the U.S. have received the treatment as part of clinical trials.
