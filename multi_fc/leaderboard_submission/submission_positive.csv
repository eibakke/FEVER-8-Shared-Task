16,The plentiful evidence we have indicates that masks would not meaningfully help with aerosol transmission of COVID 19.,"Can wearing a face mask be effective in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 if people do not comply with wearing them or if it leads to increased contact due to a false sense of security?		
Even though there is now significant agreement in the medical literature that respiratory transmission of COVID-19 is the dominant vector (Meyerowitz et al. 2020), and many clinical studies have shown that face masks reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and similar illnesses (Chu et al. 2020, Prather et al. 2020, Leung et al. 2020, Greenhalgh et al. 2020), a face mask mandate may not be effective in practice if it fails to increase the prevalence of mask wearing (compliance), or if it leads to increased contact due to a false sense of security.		

Does the evidence suggest that masks are effective in reducing the transmission of COVID-19?		
However, a recent study in patients with seasonal coronaviruses has demonstrated that surgical face masks significantly reduced detection of viral RNA in aerosols and shows a trend in reducing viral RNA in droplets.4 A recent meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials also showed that surgical masks are as effective as N95 masks in reducing transmission of influenza‐like diseases.6 If the result from a case–control study during the SARS‐CoV‐1 outbreak in Hong Kong is any indication, frequent masks use (mainly surgical) in public places can be protective by 64%.7		

Do N95 masks provide a significant benefit in preventing the transmission of COVID-19 compared to surgical masks?		
Although surgical masks have lower filtration efficiency than N95 respirators, observational studies have shown no significant benefit of N95 masks over surgical masks for prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (odds ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.22-3.33) or other respiratory viruses (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.85-1.08).3 For health care workers, routine care for a patient with COVID-19 if both are wearing surgical masks is not considered to be a high-risk occupational exposure.3 Yet, SARS-CoV-2 viral particles have been identified in the air for several hours after an aerosolizing event simulated in a laboratory and near air vents in a clinical setting.3 A group of 239 scientists recently signed an open letter urging the World Health Organization and other international public health bodies to recommend additional precautions (though not N95 masks specifically) to protect against potential airborne transmission, highlighting several recent superspreading events in which SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurred in poorly ventilated areas.5 These instances raise concern for the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission; however, the viability and infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in aerosol form remains unknown.		

Does the evidence suggest that masks are effective in reducing the transmission of COVID-19?		
The use of face masks can be effective at reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-21, 2. Theoretical studies show that the extent of disease outbreaks is dependent on population compliance with mask usage and effectiveness of the masks at reducing viral transmission3.		

Does the use of surgical masks prevent the transmission of COVID-19?		
Importantly, no documented SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks have been linked to settings in which surgical masks were assiduously used in lieu of N95 masks, which suggests that even if airborne transmission is a considerable contributor to SARS-CoV-2 transmission, surgical masks are likely sufficient to prevent it.3 Because the infectious dose of virus required to cause clinical infection also remains unknown, it is possible that blocking most, even if not all, viral particles through masks with lower filtration efficiencies of submicron particles is sufficient to prevent disease in the vast majority of cases.		

Does the evidence from the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine suggest that homemade fabric masks are effective in preventing the transmission of aerosols implicated in the spread of COVID-19?		
Limited, indirect evidence from lab studies suggests that homemade fabric masks may capture large respiratory droplets, but there is no evidence they impede the transmission of aerosols implicated in the spread of COVID-19, according to a paper published yesterday by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.		

Does wearing a surgical mask prevent the spread of COVID-19?		
With a surgical mask, coronavirus was not detected in either respiratory droplets or aerosols, suggesting that surgical masks may be effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19.		

Can face masks prevent the transmission of COVID-19?		
Another study, “Respiratory virus shedding in exhaled breath and efficacy of face masks”, published in Nature Research on 3 April, found that face masks could prevent the transmission of human coronaviruses by filtering respiratory droplets.		

What is the effectiveness of cloth masks in preventing the transmission of COVID-19?		
In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19 transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with many potentially infectious people.		

What does the available clinical trial data suggest about the effectiveness of face masks in reducing respiratory virus transmission in the community?		
However, clinical trial data on the ability of face masks to reduce respiratory virus transmission in the community are limited to 1 published prospective trial, which showed lack of efficacy (12).

44,Deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at “pox parties” could be a good way to help create herd immunity against COVID-19 without a vaccine.,"Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a recommended method for achieving herd immunity against COVID-19?		
Herd immunity for COVID-19 through natural infection can pose many challenges. COVID-19 can cause serious complications and millions of deaths, therefore the experts recommend trying to achieve herd immunity through vaccination.		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a recommended method for achieving herd immunity against COVID-19?		
Herd immunity against COVID-19 should be achieved by protecting people through vaccination, not by exposing them to the pathogen that causes the disease.		

According to the World Health Organization, what is the recommended method for achieving herd immunity against COVID-19?		
WHO supports achieving 'herd immunity' through vaccination, not by allowing a disease to spread through any segment of the population, as this would result in unnecessary cases and deaths.		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a scientifically supported method for creating herd immunity against COVID-19?		
However, according to the World Health Organization, “Attempts to reach herd immunity through exposing people to a virus are scientifically problematic and morally unethical.”		

Is deliberately infecting children with COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a viable alternative to vaccination for achieving herd immunity?		
A vaccine for the virus that causes COVID-19 would be an ideal approach to achieving herd immunity. Vaccines create immunity without causing illness or resulting complications.		

Can deliberately infecting children at ""pox parties"" be an effective way to create herd immunity against COVID-19?		
It is currently unclear how herd immunity could happen for COVID-19. For example, the data are insufficient to show how much immunity infection confers, or whether it’s enough to prevent re-infection.		

Does the evidence support the claim that deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at “pox parties” could be a good way to help create herd immunity against COVID-19 without a vaccine?		
Herd immunity, which occurs when enough people become immune to a contagious disease to make further spread unlikely, is a ""dangerous fallacy unsupported by the scientific evidence,"" the scientists wrote.		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a viable method for creating herd immunity against COVID-19 without a vaccine?		
Achieving natural immunity, an unfavorable outcome by any measure, would mean exposing susceptible groups to a debilitating and potentially fatal disease—meaning more people could die in the process of achieving herd immunity.		

Can deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" help create herd immunity against COVID-19 without a vaccine?		
- Implications of natural herd immunity. Relying on natural immunity from the disease progression of COVID-19 could allow a population to establish herd immunity.		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a scientifically supported strategy to create herd immunity against COVID-19 without a vaccine?		
Herd immunity has been a hot topic since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Can it be a possible strategy to combat COVID-19?

45,Cutting the umbilical cord straight away deliberately denies the baby natural immunity so that medical professionals have a reason to vaccinate and medicate them.,"What are the benefits of delayed cord clamping after delivery?		
Delayed cord clamping (anytime beyond 60 seconds after delivery) has benefits to the baby. This is because delayed cord clamping allows more blood to transfer from the placenta to the infant, which increases the baby’s red blood cells and iron stores, and reduces the risk of anemia.		

Does delaying the clamping of the umbilical cord increase the baby's iron stores and haemoglobin concentrations?		
A more liberal approach to delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in healthy term infants appears to be warranted, particularly in light of growing evidence that delayed cord clamping increases early haemoglobin concentrations and iron stores in infants.		

Does cutting the umbilical cord immediately after birth deny the baby natural immunity?		
There is growing evidence that delayed cord clamping is beneficial and can improve the infant's iron status for up to 6 months after birth.		

Does delayed umbilical cord clamping have any benefits for newborn babies?		
Delayed umbilical cord clamping appears to be beneficial for term and preterm infants. In term infants, delayed umbilical cord clamping increases hemoglobin levels at birth and improves iron stores in the first several months of life, which may have a favorable effect on developmental outcomes.		

Does delayed cord clamping provide any benefits to the newborn in terms of immunity?		
Delayed cord clamping provides more placental transfusion between the placenta and the newborn, whereas immediate cord clamping allows for immediate resuscitation of the premature newborn by a neonatologist (193).		

Is delayed cord clamping the standard practice for full-term births?		
Delayed cord clamping is not standard medical practice in full-term births. The standard of care in obstetrics right now only calls for delayed cord clamping with premature babies who are more in need of the increase in blood volume compared to full-term babies.		

Does cutting the umbilical cord immediately after birth cause harm to the baby?		
It has now been shown to provide no benefit to the mother and to result in harm to the neonate. The clinical trial evidence relating to delayed cord clamping compared to immediate cord clamping is presented and the physiological rationale for delayed cord clamping is discussed in this paper.		

Does delayed umbilical cord clamping provide any benefits to the baby?		
However, the authors concluded that given the benefit of delayed umbilical cord clamping in term infants, delayed cord clamping is beneficial overall, provided that the obstetrician–gynecologist or other obstetric care provider has the ability to monitor and treat jaundice.		

What is the concern about the universal implementation of delayed umbilical cord clamping?		
The universal implementation of delayed umbilical cord clamping has raised concern. Delay in umbilical cord clamping may delay timely resuscitation efforts, if needed, especially in preterm infants.		

What are the benefits of delayed cord clamping according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)?		
According to ACOG, delayed cord clamping can provide several benefits to a newborn baby:

46,The umbilical cord should not be cut until 1 hour after birth or they baby will not have enough blood right after birth.,"What are the benefits and risks of delayed cord clamping after birth?		
Delayed cord clamping, defined as waiting to clamp the umbilical cord for one to three minutes after birth or until cord pulsation has ceased, is associated with benefits in term infants, including higher birth weight, higher hemoglobin concentration, improved iron stores at six months, and improved respiratory transition.35 Benefits are even greater with preterm infants.36 However, delayed cord clamping is associated with an increase in jaundice requiring phototherapy.35 Delayed cord clamping is indicated with all deliveries unless urgent resuscitation is needed.		

What are the benefits of delayed umbilical cord clamping for newborn babies?		
Delayed umbilical cord clamping appears to be beneficial for term and preterm infants. In term infants, delayed umbilical cord clamping increases hemoglobin levels at birth and improves iron stores in the first several months of life, which may have a favorable effect on developmental outcomes.		

What is the recommended time frame for cutting the umbilical cord after birth to ensure the baby has enough blood right after birth?		
Delayed umbilical cord clamping in term neonates has been shown to result in improved neonatal hemoglobin levels at 24 to 48 hours of life, improved iron stores at 3 to 6 months of age, and improved neurodevelopmental indices through 4 years of age.1-4 Given these benefits, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in January 2017 expanded the recommendation for delayed umbilical cord clamping for at least 30 to 60 seconds after birth from only preterm to both preterm and term neonates, irrespective of mode of delivery.5		

Is it recommended to delay cutting the umbilical cord after birth?		
Delaying cord clamping for at least 30–60 seconds after delivery is recommended by national and international organizations.1–6 In term newborns, delayed cord clamping has been shown to increase blood volume,7		

What are the benefits of delaying the cutting of the umbilical cord after birth?		
Delayed cord clamping (anytime beyond 60 seconds after delivery) has benefits to the baby. This is because delayed cord clamping allows more blood to transfer from the placenta to the infant, which increases the baby’s red blood cells and iron stores, and reduces the risk of anemia.		

Does delaying the clamping of the umbilical cord increase the amount of blood in a newborn baby?		
A more liberal approach to delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in healthy term infants appears to be warranted, particularly in light of growing evidence that delayed cord clamping increases early haemoglobin concentrations and iron stores in infants.		

What is the recommended timing for cutting the umbilical cord after birth?		
At birth, delayed umbilical cord clamping (DCC) allows time for placental transfusion to the newborn and may provide benefits to both preterm and term infants compared to immediately cord clamping (ICC)		

Does delaying the clamping of the umbilical cord after birth increase the infant's blood volume?		
Traditionally, practitioners have clamped the umbilical cord immediately after birth. Previous studies have shown that delaying cord clamping results in a 20 to 30 percent increase in an infant’s blood volume.		

Does delayed cord clamping improve the infant's iron status after birth?		
There is growing evidence that delayed cord clamping is beneficial and can improve the infant's iron status for up to 6 months after birth.		

Does delayed cord clamping result in higher birth weight and increased iron stores in the baby?		
They concluded that delayed cord clamping offers significant advantages to the baby, such as higher birth weight, increased hemoglobin levels at birth, and increased iron stores in the first several months of life, with no additional risk of PPH or retained placenta for the birthing person.

5G technology raises certain public health concerns. The health effects of radiofrequency (RF) radiation have been the subject of numerous studies, with mixed results.		

Is there evidence that 5G poses health risks similar to those associated with 3G and 4G cell phones?		
Research has shown health risks associated with 3G and 4G cell phones but there is very little public information about the health effects of higher frequency 5G. Scientists, however, have called for pausing the 5G rollout until more independent research is conducted.		

Does the available scientific evidence support the claim that 5G technology poses health risks?		
In its 2018 review, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority concluded that ""despite the lack of established mechanism[s] for affecting health with weak radio wave exposure there is however need for more research covering the novel frequency domains, used for 5G."" In August 2019, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced that the commission proposes to maintain its current RF exposure safety standards (adopted in 1996), quoting a statement from the Director of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health that ""[t]he available scientific evidence to date does not support adverse health effects in humans due to exposures at or under the current limits.""		

Is there evidence that 5G technology has been classified as a potential carcinogen by a reputable health organization?		
Still, fears persist, in part because of inconclusive studies. Many critics of 5G and other wireless technologies point to the fact that the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer classified mobile phones as ""possibly carcinogenic"" in 2011.		

Is there any evidence that 5G technology poses a risk to human health within the current exposure limits?		
Within current exposure limits, there appears to be little or no risk of adverse health effects related to radiofrequency (RF) exposure from 5G systems, concludes an evidence-based expert review in the June issue of Health Physics, official journal of the Health Physics Society.		

Is there substantial evidence to support the claim that 5G technology has adverse public health and environmental effects?		
Scientists and physicians on the other hand have called for a moratorium on 5G with a 5G Appeal. They feel there is substantial evidence of adverse public health and environmental effects, along with the uncontested fact that there is little research on health or environmental effects of 5G technology, although research indicates there area adverse effects on skin and eyes.		

Do public health scholars believe that the radio frequencies emitted by 5G antennas are safe?		
Some suggest caution noting that 5G could spark global trade and security disputes, and public health scholars remain skeptical about whether the radio frequencies emitted by 5G antennas are indeed safe (see Mattern 2019; Moskowitz 2019).		

Is there sufficient evidence to confirm the safety of 5G wireless technology?		
There may be adverse health effects from the use of 5G wireless technology, but not enough research has been done to verify that it’s safe, according to health experts.		

Does the evidence from the IEEE's International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety contradict the claim made by Scientific American magazine about the safety of 5G technology?		
A paper published in 2005 by the engineering professional organization IEEE’s International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety reviewing more than 1,300 peer-reviewed studies on the biological effects of radio frequencies found ""no adverse health effects that were not thermally related.""		

Does the available scientific evidence support the claim that 5G technology poses health risks to humans?		
Although Foster admitted that research on the effects of long-term exposure to 5G millimeter waves was lacking, he restated the FDA’s position that ""[t]he available scientific evidence to date does not support adverse health effects in humans due to exposures at or under the current limits.”

However these measures proved ineffective in countering the effects of anti-insurgency campaigns which, by targeting alleged critics of the government as sympathizers of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing the New People's Army (NPA), allowed a pattern of ""disappearances"" carried out by state agents to continue.		

What is the definition of ""red-tagging"" according to the Philippine government?		
Commonly defined as the harassment or persecution of a person because of ""known or suspected communist sympathies,""[2] the extensive history of red-tagging in the Philippines has led to the recognition of several formal definitions by the Philippine government.

137,it is unknown whether a person under 20 can pass the disease to an older adult.,"Is there an age gradient in terms of transmission risk from children to adults?		
There is new evidence, including from a recent comprehensive study from South Korea, suggesting there is an age gradient in terms of transmission risk from children, meaning younger children (<10 years old) are less likely to transmit compared to adults, while older children (10 and older) may transmit at levels similar to adults.		

Does the lower susceptibility of children to SARS-CoV-2 infection imply that they are unable to pass the disease to older adults?		
Preliminary evidence suggests that children have a lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with adults, but the role that children and adolescents play in transmission of this virus remains unclear.		

Can people under the age of 20 pass the COVID-19 virus to older adults?		
Although children and young adults are reportedly at lower risk for severe disease and death from infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), than are persons in other age groups (1), younger persons can experience infection and subsequently transmit infection to those at higher risk for severe illness (2–4).		

Do epidemiological and modeling studies suggest that older children are more likely to drive transmission of the disease to other age groups?		
Epidemiological and modeling studies of transmission focused on households and daycare centers suggest that toddlers and older children, rather than infants, drive transmission in the population (11–14).		

Is it possible for a person under 20 to pass COVID-19 to an older adult?		
Therefore, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from children is plausible. Considering the relatively low frequency of infected children, even in severely affected areas, biological or other unknown factors could lead to the lower transmission in this population.		

Can a person under 20 years old pass the COVID-19 disease to an older adult?		
Increased prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among younger adults likely contributes to community transmission of COVID-19, including to persons at higher risk for severe illness, such as older adults.		

Can a person under 20 years old pass the COVID-19 disease to an older adult?		
There is now extensive literature on household transmission involving children 28 , 31 , 37 , 54 and these reported that children were less susceptible to COVID‐19 than adults at home.		

Can people under the age of 20 potentially pass the disease to older adults, despite being at a lower risk of infection themselves?		
Evidence so far indicates that children are at a lower risk of infection, present with milder symptoms, and are much less likely to die from the infection compared to older adults, but they still could present a risk to others in their household, especially in households with people at higher risk, such as older adults and others with pre-existing conditions.		

Is the likelihood of disease transmission higher in older children compared to younger children?		
disease and transmission is likely to be higher in older than younger children [21,22].   		

Does the evidence suggest that children under 20 play a significant role in the transmission of the disease to older adults?		
Despite limited evidence, the general pattern emerges that transmission from children occurs, but contributes much less to evolution of the epidemic than do contacts between adults, and school-re-openings have not lead to transmission spikes in low transmission countries (e28).

A majority of Americans favor retaining the provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that prohibit insurers from denying coverage or charging more to people with preexisting health conditions.1 In fact, a proposed Senate bill, the Republican-backed Ensuring Coverage for Patients with Pre-Existing Conditions Act, would maintain certain provisions under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that prevent insurers from refusing coverage to people or varying premiums based on whether they have a preexisting condition.2

On the Senate floor Tuesday, Cornyn forcefully denied that he's against covering preexisting conditions and touted a bill he co-sponsored to protect people with preexisting conditions.

The ACA's provision on preexisting conditions has survived many challenges. Public officials of both major political parties have expressed commitment to the issue and have offered various plans to protect Americans with preexisting conditions from being denied coverage.		

Does John Cornyn's plan guarantee that people with pre-existing conditions will be able to purchase health insurance?

Does John Cornyn's plan guarantee that insurers must sell plans to any patient with pre-existing conditions?

153,President Trump and I have a plan to improve healthcare and protect pre-existing conditions for every American.,"Does President Trump have a plan to protect pre-existing conditions for every American, as he claims?		
Facts First: Trump’s claim about protecting those with pre-existing conditions is false. Though Trump says he would do this, his administration has consistently taken steps to undermine the Affordable Care Act – including joining a lawsuit aimed at striking down the law – without presenting alternative plans that would offer similar benefits.		

Does President Trump's plan to protect people with pre-existing conditions if the ACA is overturned actually protect them, or is it just a promise?		
President Trump has vowed to protect people with pre-existing conditions if the ACA is overturned and recently issued an executive order saying it is the “policy of the United States” to “ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions can obtain the insurance of their choice at affordable rates.”		

Does the Trump administration's actions align with President Trump's claim of having a plan to protect pre-existing conditions for every American?		
Protecting coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. The Trump administration has abandoned its duty to defend current laws in court, cheering on efforts to destroy protections for pre-existing conditions, insurance coverage for dependents until they’re 26, and the other critical Affordable Care Act benefits.		

Does the administration of President Trump support the Affordable Care Act, which currently protects people with pre-existing conditions?		
Protections for people with preexisting conditions are already in place under the Affordable Care Act, though the administration — as the order emphasizes — wants to get rid of that law.		

Does the Trump administration's current actions in court align with President Trump's claim of protecting pre-existing conditions for every American?

Does President Trump's plan to improve healthcare actually protect pre-existing conditions for every American?		
President Trump’s record includes support for legislation to repeal and replace the ACA that would have weakened pre-existing condition protections, and expansion of short-term insurance plans that are not required to cover pre-existing conditions.		

Does the Trump administration have a comprehensive plan to protect pre-existing conditions for every American?		
The Trump administration has not offered a comprehensive alternative to the ACA. In 2017, Trump backed Republican plans that would have weakened the preexisting condition protections in the ACA.		

Does the Trump administration have a clear plan to protect people with pre-existing conditions?		
THE FACTS: There is no clear plan. People with preexisting conditions are already protected by the Obama-era Affordable Care Act, and if the Trump administration succeeds in persuading the Supreme Court to overturn it, those protections will be jeopardy.		

Did the Trump administration and you (presumably the speaker) actually implement a plan to protect pre-existing conditions for every American, despite both sides of the aisle recognizing the need for such protections?		
Both sides of the aisle have recognized the need for protections around pre-existing conditions. As the Trump Administration pursued dismantling the Affordable Care Act, Republicans introduced a bill in the Senate and Democrats passed a bill in the House that each aimed to protect patients with pre-existing conditions.		

How does the Trump administration's court action to dismantle the Affordable Care Act align with their claim of protecting pre-existing conditions?

239,"Judith Collins, the National Party leader stated that New Zealand was using more coal to generate electricity because of the oil and gas exploration ban.","Did Judith Collins claim that the oil and gas exploration ban led to an increase in coal consumption in New Zealand?		
The New Zealand government’s ban on new offshore oil and gas exploration has come under fire, with the National Party claiming it has led to increased energy costs and a rise in coal consumption.		

Did Judith Collins claim that the oil and gas exploration ban led to an increase in the use of coal for electricity generation in New Zealand?		
AAP FactCheck Investigation: Has the New Zealand government’s ban on new offshore oil and gas exploration resulted in an increase in energy prices and a rise in the consumption of imported coal?		

Is Judith Collins' claim that New Zealand is using more coal to generate electricity because of the oil and gas exploration ban supported by the evidence that New Zealand's domestic gas and oil reserves have declined over the past 10 years?		
New Zealand’s domestic gas and oil reserves have declined over the past 10 years, and as a result the amount of primary energy supplied by New Zealand oil has decreased.		

Is the oil and gas exploration ban the primary reason for the increase in coal usage for electricity generation in New Zealand?		
However, it is not clear that the ban on offshore gas exploration had resulted in a reduction in gas-powered generation in favour of coal as the Pohokura outages have been repeatedly identified as a key influence on supply.		

Is the ban on oil and gas exploration in New Zealand leading to an increase in coal consumption for electricity generation?		
This status is likely to continue for some time. Electricity generation consumes about 20 percent of New Zealand’s domestic coal supply, and consumption is unlikely to increase in the future.		

Is the increase in coal usage in New Zealand's electricity generation a result of the oil and gas exploration ban?		
New Zealand’s use of energy has doubled every 22 years over the past century. While renewable energy has been an important source, particularly because of the use of hydro power for electricity, New Zealand has increasingly relied on non-renewable, fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas.		

Is the oil and gas exploration ban likely to have an immediate impact on New Zealand's electricity generation?		
The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment (PCE) investigated the impact of the government’s oil and gas exploration ban and found it was likely to have an impact on gas and electricity prices only once the current exploration and mining permits expired (page 36).		

Is Judith Collins correct that New Zealand is using more coal to generate electricity due to the oil and gas exploration ban?		
New Zealand’s changing electricity market has seen improvements in the management of dry year events, along with a significant decrease in coal-fired generation, and by 2018 the two coal units will no longer be required unless market conditions change significantly.”		

Is the decline in oil and gas production in New Zealand a reason for an increase in coal use for electricity generation?		
Production of both oil and gas in New Zealand has been consistently dropping in recent years and renewables increase, the ban may simply ensure this trajectory continues.		

Is New Zealand increasing its use of coal for electricity generation?		
Energy Minister David Parker said that wind and geothermal generation are the keys to helping New Zealand switch future electricity production away from fossil fuels used in coal and gas electricity plants.

242,"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention downgrades COVID-19, rating it less fatal than seasonal flu","What is the estimated mortality ratio of COVID-19 based on existing data?		
Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality will take some time to fully understand, existing data suggest that the mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of reported cases) is between 3-4%.		

Is the death rate of COVID-19 lower than that of the seasonal flu, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention?		
It is true that the CDC has reported the possibility of a 0.2% death rate for the coronavirus. More specifically, the CDC in its ""Pandemic Planning Scenarios"" document estimated the death rate was about 0.26%, a number calculated by combining the CDC estimates for the death rate for symptomatic cases and the number of infected people who have no symptoms.		

Does the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's assessment of COVID-19 contradict the World Health Organization's estimate of its mortality rate?		
Fauci said COVID-19 is at least 10 times ""more lethal"" than the seasonal flu, even if the mortality rate drops far below the World Health Organization's current estimate of 3.4%.		

Was the adjusted mortality rate of COVID-19 1% at the time the CDC made the comparison with seasonal flu?		
The adjusted mortality rate from coronavirus of 1% was then compared with the 0.1% mortality rate from seasonal influenza, and the conclusion was reported to the House Committee that the coronavirus was 10-times more lethal than seasonal influenza.		

How does the number of reported COVID-19 deaths compare to the number of reported influenza deaths in the week ending April 11, 2020?		
The CDC also publishes provisional counts of COVID-19 deaths but acknowledges that its reporting lags behind other public data sources.7 For the week ending April 11, 2020, data indicate that the number of provisionally reported COVID-19 deaths was 14.4-fold greater than influenza deaths during the apparent peak week of the current season (week ending February 29, 2020), consistent with the ranges based on CDC statistics.6 As the CDC continues to revise its COVID-19 counts to account for delays in reporting, the ratio of counted COVID-19 deaths to influenza deaths is likely to increase.		

Does the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's assessment of COVID-19 contradict the findings of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention?		
The coronavirus is more fatal than the flu across all age ranges, but especially among older people, according to research from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention published in mid-February.		

Is the COVID-19 mortality rate as reported by the WHO consistent with the claim that it is less fatal than the seasonal flu?		
Based on the WHO's most recent mortality rate of 3.4%, the COVID-19 outbreak is shaping up to be at least 34 times deadlier than the flu, which has a mortality rate of about 0.1% and kills 290,000 to 650,000 people per year across the globe.		

What is the reported case fatality rate of the H1N1 influenza virus (1918) according to the WHO?		
Furthermore, the WHO reported that the CFR of the H1N1 influenza virus (1918) is also 2-3%,14 similar to the unadjusted 2-3% CFR of the coronavirus reported in Congressional testimony, with no meaningful difference in mortality.

264,Donald Trump has not appoointed any black federal judges.,"How many African American federal judges has Donald Trump appointed during his presidency?		
More broadly, President Trump’s lack of commitment to diversifying the federal judiciary continues to be deeply disturbing – he has appointed the least diverse group of nominees in decades.[50] Of his 56 appellate nominees, not a single one is African American.		

What is the racial diversity of the federal judges appointed by Donald Trump during his first two years in office?		
As a Republican president, it is not at all unexpected that Trump has used the nominations process to appoint conservative judges to the bench.50 What is worrisome, especially given the recent trend even among Republican presidents towards increasing diversity on the federal bench, is that Trump’s judicial appointees have been woefully lacking in diversity.51 Although snapshots of the demographic profile of the federal judges appointed by Trump vary slightly depending on the timing, an independent analysis of Trump’s judicial appointees from demographic data compiled by the Federal Judicial Center suggests that of the eighty-three judges confirmed in Trump’s first two years in office, only seven are minorities and twenty are women (including two women of color), making his appointees 92 percent white and 76 percent male.52		

How many African American federal judges has Donald Trump appointed out of his total 68 federal judge appointees?		
Alarmingly, just one of Trump’s 68 federal judge appointees count as African American. Further, Trump has already appointed 26 appeals court judges, which is more than any other president in the first two years of a presidency, according to the Brookings Institution.		

What is the extent to which Donald Trump's judicial appointments have impacted the diversity of the federal bench?		
In addition to failing to nominate women and minority judges who would increase the diversity of the bench, in multiple instances Trump has further reduced the diversity of the federal bench by replacing women and minority judges with white men.60 Rorie Solberg and Eric Waltenburg, who study and have written extensively on the diversity of the federal judiciary, measured the extent to which judicial appointments have increased, decreased, or maintained the diversity of the federal bench across successive presidential administrations.61 They report that Trump has nominated the lowest share of judges who have increased the diversity of the bench since Ronald Reagan.62 More tellingly, Trump has nominated the highest share of judges who have decreased the diversity of the bench (by a margin of more than two to one) since before the Carter Administration.63		

What is the racial diversity of the federal judges appointed by Donald Trump during his first two years in office?		
This pattern is difficult to explain as anything other than Trump’s deliberate attempt to reverse the decades-long trend by his presidential predecessors (across both Democratic and Republican administrations) of increasing the diversity of the federal bench.58 None of the nearly fifty federal appellate judges nominated by Trump in his first two years in office were African American, despite representing the largest share of sitting minority judges, and none were Hispanic, the second largest minority group among sitting federal judges.59		

What is the racial and ethnic diversity of the federal judges appointed by President Donald Trump?		
President Trump is appointing federal judges at a rapid pace, yet his judicial picks are the least racially and ethnically diverse of any presidential administration over the past 30 years.		

What percentage of Donald Trump's confirmed appeals court judges are Black?		
Just one of Trump’s 53 confirmed appeals court judges is Hispanic and none are Black. That compares to about 27% of President Barack Obama’s and roughly 15% under President George W. Bush, according to a Bloomberg Law analysis of Federal Judicial Center data.		

How does the number of minority judges appointed by Donald Trump compare to his predecessors?		
In addition to being prolific, there is a striking pattern to Trump’s judicial appointees. He has broken with a decades-long presidential tradition of making the judiciary more demographically diverse than one’s political predecessor.7 Instead, Trump has appointed fewer minority judges to the federal bench than any president since Ronald Reagan and fewer women judges than any president since George H.W. Bush.8		

What percentage of Donald Trump's federal judicial nominees have been white?		
This detrimental shift against judicial diversity is evidenced in President Trump’s recent federal judicial nominees, which have been 91% white and 81% male.[86]		

How many minority judges did President Barack Obama appoint to the federal bench?		
By far the most notable increase in the diversity of the federal judiciary came during the first black presidency.36 Although not known for making any express commitment to improving judicial diversity, President Barack Obama’s actions spoke louder than any words could.37 Obama appointed more women and minority judges to the federal bench than Reagan and both Bushes combined.38 He appointed 137 women judges and 118 minority judges to the bench, including more Asian American women than all forty-three of his presidential predecessors combined.39 While Reagan and Clinton each appointed a single female Justice to the Supreme Court, Obama was the first president to appoint two women to the Supreme Court, one of whom was also the first Hispanic Justice appointed to the nation’s highest Court.40 These appointments tripled the number of women on the Supreme Court (from one to three), making the Court more closely resemble the gender demography of the country than ever before.41

270,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said of US employers, “Employers cutting hours is a good thing. It then gives that person time to pursue their dreams and passions.”","Does Nancy Pelosi think that employers cutting hours is a good thing?		
- Says U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi said, “Employers cutting hours is a good thing. It then gives that person time to pursue their dreams and passions.”		

How might the new law allowing employees to request flexible work hours impact employers?		
Roughly 35 percent of those surveyed said they might consider requesting flexible work hours at some point (Pilon 2014).51 Thus, the new law may prove to be a popular option for employees, but at the same time, employers will not be overrun with such requests, if only one in three employees are even considering making such a request.		

What does the proposed federal legislation do to protect employees who request or use flexible work arrangements?		
Like the proposed federal legislation, it protects employees who request or use flexible work arrangements from retaliation or discrimination, a key component to prevent such arrangements from becoming a gender segregating practice (see Powell 2013).		

What does House Speaker Nancy Pelosi believe is a positive outcome for US employers?		
This will reinforce the existing “business case” for employers to provide more predictable, stable work schedules for employees for firm performance.7 Based on research reviewed here that worker earnings insecurity has risen and is detrimental to macroeconomic stability, it provides support for adopting policy measures that would temper fluctuations in the daily and weekly work hours of hourly paid employees.		

Does House Speaker Nancy Pelosi believe that employers cutting hours is beneficial for employees?		
Policy efforts to curb such hours of overemployment, such as a right to refuse extra work hours without retaliation, might go some way toward reducing underemployment of other part-time employees, were they in the same establishment.		

How many American workers believe their employers value work-life balance?		
Only 52 percent of American workers believe their employers value work-life balance, which comes as no surprise, as just 39 percent reported that their employers provide options for flexible work and 30 percent said their employers provide benefits that help them more easily meet their non-work demands.

What workplace policies did House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggest could benefit American workers and businesses?		
They talked about the ways American workers, businesses, and the overall economy could benefit from improved workplace policies, including extended maternity and paternity leave, increased access to child care, more paid sick and vacation time, and flexible work schedules.		

Does House Speaker Nancy Pelosi support employers cutting hours for their employees?		
This measure advised the Berkeley, California, City Council to adopt an ordinance that would allow both private- and public-sector workers to request part-time work, and to ask the state and federal governments to draft legislation to give employees a right to shorter or more flexible work hours unless a legitimate business reason for denial of the request was presented in writing.		

What benefits would employees in companies with 15 or more employees gain from the proposed policy change?		
It would provide employees in all companies with 15 or more employees not only a right to request more flexible, predictable, or stable hours, but a “right to receive” schedule changes for those employees with caregiving or education responsibilities, unless the employer has bona fide business reasons for not doing so.

303,There is a double standard in how Senate Republicans handled the confirmations for Obama's and Trump's high court picks.,"How did Senate Republicans handle the confirmations for Obama's and Trump's high court picks, and were the processes similar or different?		
In 2016, the Republican-controlled Senate refused even to hold hearings on Judge Garland, President Barack Obama’s nominee to fill the seat left open after Justice Scalia passed away.8 Thus, critics argue, President Donald Trump’s subsequent nominee Justice Gorsuch sits in a “stolen” seat.9 The 2018 confirmation process for Justice Kavanaugh was said to be problematic in several respects: Republicans withheld information about the nominee’s service in the White House10 and failed to adequately investigate charges of sexual assault;11 and the nominee himself offered what many saw as openly partisan testimony in responding to the latter allegations.12 Through these confirmation fights, the critique goes, Republicans used underhanded means to place a conservative majority on the Supreme Court, rendering the institution itself (and, presumably, its decisions)		

Did Senate Republicans handle the confirmations for Obama's and Trump's high court picks differently, and if so, what were the key differences in their handling of these nominations?		
Recent years have seen intense conflicts over federal judicial appointments, culminating in Senate Republicans' 2016 refusal to consider the nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, Senate Democrats' 2017 filibuster of Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the same seat, and Republicans' triggering of the ""nuclear option"" to confirm Gorsuch.		

Did the Senate Republicans consider Obama's Supreme Court nominee in 2016, and if so, what was the reason for their decision?		
But in March 2016, following the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, the Republican-controlled Senate refused to consider Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland to the court—or even grant him a hearing—arguing that the Senate hadn’t confirmed an election year nominee since 1932.		

Did the Senate hold hearings on Merrick Garland's nomination?		
Although Obama had put forward Merrick Garland, a judicial moderate, as Scalia’s replacement in March 2016, the majority leader of the Senate, Republican Mitch McConnell, refused to schedule a vote or even to hold hearings on Garland’s nomination, declaring that the Senate should not consider any Supreme Court nominee during an election year.		

Did Senate Republicans vote on any of President Obama's nominees to replace Justice Antonin Scalia?		
Last year, when Senate Republicans refused to vote on anyone President Barack Obama nominated to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, Democrats protested that the GOP was stealing the seat, flouting more than a century of Senate precedent about how to treat Supreme Court nominees.		

How did Senate Republicans handle the confirmation process for Obama's Supreme Court nominee compared to Trump's Supreme Court nominees?		
Senate Republicans refused to hold confirmation hearings for Obama's nominee to replace Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February, leaving the court with eight members.		

Did Senate Republicans block consideration of a Supreme Court nominee during President Obama's term?		
Because of the controversial move by Senate Republicans to block consideration of Barack Obama's nominee for a vacant Supreme Court seat in 2016, Mr Trump had the opportunity to put his mark on the high court just months after taking office.		

Did the Senate Republicans hold a confirmation hearing for Merrick Garland, a Supreme Court nominee by President Obama?		
In 2016, the Republican majority in the Senate refused to hold hearings or schedule a confirmation vote on Merrick Garland, a federal judge named by President Obama to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February.		

Did the Republican Senate majority commence the confirmation process for Judge Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court?		
There was, of course, the unprecedented refusal by the Republican Senate majority to commence confirmation processes following the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland on March 16, 2016, to fill the seat vacated by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.		

Why did Senate Republicans refuse to hold confirmation hearings for President Obama's nominee to replace Justice Scalia?

What was the primary purpose of the Communications Decency Act?		
Section 230 was only a small portion of that broader legislation. The Communications Decency Act’s broader purpose was to slow the spread of child pornography on the web.		

What is the origin of the name ""Section 230"" in the US Communications Decency Act?		
Herein lies the source of the confusion surrounding the name used to refer to Section 230. Because Cox and Wyden’s legislation was placed in the same title of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 as Exon’s amendment, courts soon began referring to it as “Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act,” though it technically should be called “Section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended” or “Section 509 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.”		

What is the original purpose of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA)?		
I believe that Section 230 can and should be extricated from Exon’s purposes, at least partly. Section 230 was only a part of the CDA to the extent that it was placed under the same title of the final telecommunications bill.

Charlie Hebdo, the French satirical magazine attacked on Wednesday, has a controversial history of depicting Mohammed, often in an unfavorable light, which has angered many Muslims around the world.		

Does the award given to Charlie Hebdo by PEN suggest that the organization supports the magazine's content, including its depiction of the Prophet?		
In their letter, the group claimed that by giving Charlie Hebdo the award, PEN was “not simply conveying support for freedom of expression, but also valorizing selectively offensive material: material that intensifies the anti-Islamic, anti-Maghreb, anti-Arab sentiments already prevalent in the Western world.”		

Did the attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo reveal the hatred and hostility of the political and cultural institutions of the Western world against Islam and the Muslim community?		
An attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo, a controversial French satirical magazine, and the mainstream discourse immediately rehashes the same concepts and talking points about the importance of safeguarding freedom of speech, battling an ill-defined notion of terrorism, and maintaining western values.		

Did the attack on Charlie Hebdo occur in response to the magazine's republication of caricatures depicting Muhammad?		
This attack came after the magazine’s republication of caricatures depicting Muhammad. The assailant cited his actions as vengeance for the caricatures, highlighting the ongoing tension and controversy surrounding Charlie Hebdo.		

What kind of sentiment did the writers of Charlie Hebdo express in the months prior to 9/11?

390,"The NFL, NBA and MLB have Tax-Exempt status.","Why do some people dispute the tax-exempt status of the NFL and other sports leagues?		
Over the years, sports leagues have faced opposition to their 501(c)(6) tax exemptions. For example, opponents disputed the National Football League's (NFL) nonprofit status due to the league's high executive salaries and large revenues.		

Under what circumstances did the NFL, NBA, and MLB have tax-exempt status?		
The Senate bill would eliminate the tax exemption for professional all sports leagues. Since 1966, U.S. tax law has specifically exempted professional football leagues from tax under section 501(c)(6); the IRS has historically applied this exemption to all professional sports leagues.		

Does Section 501(c)(6) of the IRS code exempt the NFL, NBA, and MLB from paying taxes?		
Some critics have maintained that the NFL (and the NFL alone, not other sports leagues) was tax-exempt due to a special ""loophole"" inserted into the tax code in 1966, referencing Section 501(c)(6) of the IRS code, a section that specifically includes ""Professional football leagues"" along with ""business leagues, chambers of commerce, real-estate boards, or boards of trade"" as tax-exempt organizations.		

What type of tax classification do the NFL, NBA, and MLB have?		
Since 1966, the tax code has allowed leagues to classify as 501(c)(6) charitable organizations - a classification used by trade and industry organizations - under the assumption that the leagues were promoting the general value of their sports.		

What type of tax-exempt status do the NFL, NBA, and MLB currently have under US tax law?		
Under current tax law, a professional football league is granted tax-exempt status as a 501(c)(6) organization, a designation that typically applies to trade or professional organizations.		

Why do the NFL, NBA, and MLB have tax-exempt status?		
The reason the NFL doesn’t pay taxes is beyond outdated at this point. The league is a registered 501(c)(6), which “provides for exemption of business leagues, chambers of commerce, real estate boards, boards of trade, and professional football leagues.”		

What type of tax-exempt status do the NFL, NBA, and MLB have according to the tax code?		
In the tax code, the NFL is considered a 501(c)(6) nonprofit, a category intended to exempt local chambers of commerce and business associations from paying taxes as long as they benefit an entire industry or help a common business interest.		

What type of tax-exempt status does the NFL have under the Internal Revenue Code?		
According to league spokesman Brian McCarthy, the NFL is organized as a trade or industry association that is exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code, not Section 501(c)(3), which exempts charitable organizations.		

What type of tax-exempt status do the NFL, NBA, and MLB have?		
Sports leagues have historically operated as 501(c)(6) organizations. Since these entities work to advance the business interests of their affiliated teams or players, the groups qualify as business leagues or trade associations.[5][6]		

What type of tax-exempt status do the NFL, NBA, and MLB have?		
Prior to this decision, the NFL was considered a trade association under Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code, which exempted the league from paying federal income tax.[2] In 1966, after successful lobbying by the league, the Internal Revenue Service rewrote Section 501(c)(6) of the Code specifically to include “professional football leagues” as associations exempt from paying federal income taxes.[3]

How does Sen. Martha McSally's proposed plan for Medicare differ from the current Medicare system?		
The proposal ends Medicare as we know it today, replacing Medicare's guaranteed benefits with a ‘premium support' payment or voucher that consumers can use to buy private insurance.""		

What type of system would seniors use to select their own plan under the budget plan proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan?		
That’s a reference to a budget plan, first proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, that calls for changing Medicare — not ending it — to a system in which seniors would use premium-support payments to select their own plan from a Medicare exchange.		

What plan did Sen. Martha McSally support regarding Medicare?		
Like me, many of you have serious concerns about plans to privatize Medicare. The Republican budget, passed today, would end Medicare as we know it now and replace it with a voucher system where seniors go out into the private market to buy their own health insurance.		

How would Sen. Martha McSally's plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program affect the costs for seniors?		
But there are further concerns for both seniors and the nation's fiscal health under this plan. Unlike the actions taken last year in the Affordable Care Act, the measure passed today would increase health costs across the board for two reasons: a private health insurance plan covering the standardized benefit would be more expensive than traditional Medicare; and 2) as the CBO points out, ""the government's contribution would grow more slowly than health care costs, leaving more for beneficiaries to pay.""

If you have already placed your ballot in the mail but are not sure whether it has been accepted by your county board of elections, North Carolina offers a few ways to check the status of your absentee by-mail ballot without leaving your home.		

What happens if a voter in North Carolina tries to vote in person after submitting a mail-in ballot?		
- Once the ballot is accepted, that voter is marked in the system as having voted in that election. If that voter tries to vote in person, poll workers will know the person has already submitted an absentee ballot.		

What is the purpose of creating a chain of custody when submitting an absentee ballot?		
Again, rules must be carefully followed when filling out an absentee ballot. The idea is to create a chain of custody from the voter to the local elections board, and to guarantee that the person submitting the ballot is who he or she claims to be, voting only once.		

If a voter in North Carolina submits a mail-in ballot and then attempts to vote in person, will their in-person vote be counted if their name is not on the poll list?		
If your name is not on the poll list, the provisional ballot will be counted only if the county board of registrars is able to confirm, after the election, that you are a duly qualified elector of the county.		

Can a voter in North Carolina who has already submitted an absentee ballot still cast a vote in person at the polling place?		
First, a voter who has received an absentee ballot still can vote in person so long as the ballot hasn’t been returned.

Voted absentee ballots cannot be delivered to the polling place on election day. If you have not returned your absentee ballot on election day, you have the following options:

Can voters in North Carolina use a mail-in vote and then also vote in person at a polling place?		
- Rules around requesting and using a vote-by-mail absentee ballot. While North Carolina allows all voters to vote by mail if they choose, many of the laws governing the practice make it challenging to do so.		

Can voters in North Carolina cast a mail-in vote and then check that it has been counted by voting in person at the polling place?		
Note: Voters must cast their provisional ballot in the correct polling place in order for it to be counted.		

Can voters in North Carolina verify the status of their mail-in vote through an official portal?		
It’s important to follow-up and make sure your absentee ballot was accepted! You can check the status of your vote using the official North Carolina BallotTrax portal.

425,Fox News is unavailable in Canada because the Radio Act makes it a crime to lie to the public via airwaves.,"Does the Radio Act in Canada prohibit the broadcasting of false or misleading news, which has led to Fox News being unavailable in the country?		
Canada's Radio Act requires that ""a licenser may not broadcast ... any false or misleading news."" The provision has kept Fox News and right-wing talk radio out of Canada and helped make Canada a model for liberal democracy and freedom.		

Does the Radio Act in Canada prohibit the broadcasting of false or misleading information on the radio and television?		
It is true that various sections of CRTC regulations prohibit the broadcasting of ""false or misleading news"" by radio and television licensees, and that in 2011 the CRTC declined to narrow those regulations to apply only to ""news that the licensee knows is false or misleading and that endangers or is likely to endanger the lives, health or safety of the public.""		

Is Fox News available in Canada due to the Radio Act?		
The CRTC regulations apply only to Canadian broadcasters using Canadian airwaves; they do not apply to the Fox News Channel, which is a non-Canadian entity transmitted via satellite and cable, not broadcast over public airwaves.		

Is the unavailability of Fox News in Canada due to the Canada Radio Act's prohibition on broadcasting false or misleading news?		
Before Fox News even existed, Canada passed the Canada Radio Act, a law which stipulates that “a licenser may not broadcast… any false or misleading news.”		

Was Fox News' bid for broadcast in Canada rejected by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in 2003?		
Fox News first bid for broadcast in Canada -- filed by private Canadian operators, along with HBO, ESPN, and other American channels -- was rejected by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, the federal body that regulates the airwaves, in 2003.

Fox Chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch was rebuffed in his efforts to establish Fox News Canada in 2003 due to Canadian laws regarding foreign ownership of print and broadcast media, but the CRTC approved an application to bring the Fox News Channel to Canadian digital television line-ups back in November 2004, and that channel is now carried by dozens of different digital providers throughout Canada.		

Is Fox News Channel available in Canada?		
The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved an application Thursday to bring the Fox News Channel, one of the highest-rated news channels in the United States, onto Canadian digital airwaves.		

Why was Fox News denied a permit by the Canadian Radio-Television Telecommunications Commission in 2003?		
This venture would have aired a combination of Canadian and American news programming. Consequently, Fox News Canada was denied a permit by the Canadian Radio-Television Telecommunications Commission in 2003.		

Is it a crime in Canada to broadcast false information on the airwaves, according to the Radio Act?		
One version of the meme states that Fox New Channel is ""banned from operating in Canada"" because ""it's illegal in Canada to lie on airwaves.""		

Was the unavailability of Fox News in Canada due to difficulties with inserting Canadian content?		
Based on the record of the current proceeding, the Commission understands that the decision of Global TV and its partner Fox News not to launch Fox News Canada was due, in part, to difficulties with the insertion of Canadian content, difficulties which, in the Commission's view, other types of Category 2 services having non-Canadian partners would not likely encounter.

However, the use of face mask in the community remains controversial.21 , 22 WHO issued an interim guideline regarding the use of masks in the context of COVID-19 on 6 April 2020, stating no evidence that wearing a mask by healthy persons in the wider community setting can prevent acquisition of COVID-19.23 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control issued a technical report on 8 April 2020 that the use of face masks in the community could be considered, especially when visiting busy, closed spaces, despite not knowing how much the use of masks in the community can contribute to a decrease in transmission in addition to the other counter measures.24 On 3 April 2020, CDC recommended the use of cloth face coverings, especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.25

What does the World Health Organization's updated guidance on the use of masks for the control of COVID-19 say about the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19?		
WHO published updated guidance on the use of masks for the control of COVID-19, which provided updated advice on who should wear a mask, when it should be worn and what it should be made of.		

What measures, according to the WHO, are necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19 when wearing a face mask?		
The WHO's guidance on the use of medical masks makes clear that their use alone is insufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 without proper hand-washing and other measures to protect against human to human transmission.		

Does the WHO's statement about the lack of evidence for face masks protecting against Covid-19 refer to their effectiveness in the general community or in a medical setting?		
However, there is an essential distinction between absence of evidence and evidence of absence. Evidence that face masks can provide effective protection against respiratory infections in the community is scarce, as acknowledged in recommendations from the UK and Germany.7, 8 However, face masks are widely used by medical workers as part of droplet precautions when caring for patients with respiratory infections.

445,Masks lower immune systems.,"Does wearing a face mask have a negative impact on the immune system?		
The claim is misleading; wearing a face mask does not negatively impact the immune system, according to health experts; as of July 2020, international health authorities and governments around the world recommended wearing face masks as part of efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19.		

Does wearing a face mask weaken the immune system?		
The idea that wearing face masks weakens the immune system is not supported by scientific evidence. This article published on The Conversation illustrates how wearing even a cloth face covering can help to limit the spread of COVID-19 by blocking infectious droplets, which is the main mode of disease transmission.		

Does wearing a face mask weaken the human immune system?		
There is no evidence that face masks weaken the immune system. Risks associated with wearing face masks only apply to a select few in the general population.		

Does wearing a mask interfere with the normal bacteria on the body, potentially weakening the immune system?		
Mask use weakens the immune system because it interferes with the normal bacteria that live on the body, leading to increased risk for serious infection and a second peak of COVID-19 cases when social distancing stops.		

Does wearing a mask have any negative impact on the immune system?		
Mask use does not weaken the ability of the immune system to fight infection. Instead, wearing a mask helps to keep your community safe by preventing the accidental spread of COVID-19 by people who are infected but do not show symptoms.		

Does wearing a mask have a negative effect on the immune system?		
International health authorities maintain that wearing a face mask is safe and can in fact protect the immune system from the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19.		

Does wearing a mask have any effect on the immune system of the wearer?		
This study also showed that wearing a mask reduced the likelihood of seasonal influenza. A randomized clinical trial found that medical staff members who used a mask correctly had a decrease in virus transmission (MacIntyre et al., 2015).		

Does wearing a mask weaken the human immune system?		
The American Lung Association also notes in this article debunking face masks conspiracy theories that “there is absolutely no scientific evidence that mask wearing or physical distancing weakens the immune system.”		

Does wearing a mask have any impact on the immune system?		
Finally, while masks do not weaken the immune system, stress might. Now is a stressful time, and unfortunately, stress has been linked with changes in immune system function and increased risk of infections.		

Does wearing masks weaken the human immune system?		
The claim that wearing masks would weaken the immune system is also unsupported by scientific evidence.

446,"US President Trump made vaccines voluntary, not mandatory, in the US.","What authority does the President have to change the vaccination policy in the US?		
Mandating vaccination is a state power, not within the president’s jurisdiction. Trump will also lack the power to directly change the CDC’s recommended vaccination schedule, but he can appoint a new director to the CDC or the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.		

Did the Trump administration change the mandatory status of vaccines in the US?		
The Trump administration has sought to control vaccine guidance issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) — a customarily apolitical scientific regulator tasked with certifying the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, medications, and other medical treatments and technologies.		

What was the impact of the Trump administration's decision to close down the National Vaccine Program Office on vaccine safety measures in the US?		
The Trump administration’s efforts to politicize and undermine vaccine safety measures are especially damaging given the administration’s 2019 decision to close down the National Vaccine Program Office — a government body tasked with monitoring the safety of vaccines.		

Did the Trump administration initially try to prevent the implementation of vaccine guidelines in the US?		
The Trump administration later attempted to block the vaccine guidelines but ultimately allowed their implementation after protests from experts and the biotech industry concerned about undermining public trust in the FDA.		

Did the US President Trump repeal compulsory vaccination laws in the states mentioned?		
In fact, compulsory vaccination laws were repealed in California, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Utah, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.16 Finally, in 1905 the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the authority of states to pass and enforce compulsory vaccination laws.17 The Court's decision articulated the view that the freedom of the individual must sometimes be subordinated to the common welfare and subjected to the police power of the state.		

Did US President Trump change the mandatory status of vaccines in the US?		
The challenges facing US vaccine policy and vaccine policymakers are many, all the more so given the past statements of the president about vaccine safety and the tenuous place of science and expertise throughout his administration.		

Did the US government's authority to mandate vaccination remain unchanged under President Trump's administration?		
While the 1905 decision of the Supreme Court in Jacobson v. Massachusetts upheld the authority of governments to mandate vaccination (and a 1922 case—Zucht v. King—expressly permitted vaccination linked to school attendance), compulsory vaccination remained a source of considerable tension between health authorities and the public.		

Are vaccines mandatory in the US?		
Vaccination policies occur at the national and state-levels in the U.S., while vaccine 		

Does the evidence suggest that President Trump made vaccines mandatory in the US?		
Mandatory influenza vaccination of health care workers fits within the framework of constitutional powers that the government possesses to promote the public's welfare.		

How did the US policy of making vaccines voluntary come about?		
The process that led to this policy choice is of particular interest. We describe how vaccines became contentious in France and how French authorities came to view mandatory vaccination as the solution to the rise in vaccine hesitancy.

447,A virus can easily pass through a mask.,"Do some surgical masks provide low protection against airborne viruses?		
Some surgical masks may let a significant fraction of airborne viruses penetrate through their filters, providing very low protection against aerosolized infectious agents in the size range of 10 to 80 nm.		

Can surgical masks be effective in preventing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2?		
A previous study reported that surgical masks and N95 masks were equally effective in preventing the dissemination of influenza virus (4), so surgical masks might help prevent transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS–CoV-2).		

Can surgical masks effectively limit the spread of a virus?		
Surgical masks reduced the overall number of RNA copies by 3.4 fold. These results suggest an important role for aerosols in transmission of influenza virus and that surgical facemasks worn by infected persons are potentially an effective means of limiting the spread of influenza.		

Can surgical masks prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2?		
Importantly, no documented SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks have been linked to settings in which surgical masks were assiduously used in lieu of N95 masks, which suggests that even if airborne transmission is a considerable contributor to SARS-CoV-2 transmission, surgical masks are likely sufficient to prevent it.3 Because the infectious dose of virus required to cause clinical infection also remains unknown, it is possible that blocking most, even if not all, viral particles through masks with lower filtration efficiencies of submicron particles is sufficient to prevent disease in the vast majority of cases.		

Does wearing a surgical mask reduce the transmission of respiratory viruses, including coronaviruses?		
An April study found that surgical masks reduced the transmission of multiple human coronaviruses (though the research did not include this new one, SARS-CoV-2) through both respiratory droplets and smaller aerosols.		

Does wearing a mask prevent the transmission of a virus?		
Masks have been extensively studied for the role in preventing transmission of pathogenic particles.[47-56] Surgical masks prevent diseases transmitted through droplets, from the healthcare worker to the patient, or vice versa.[57,58]		

How effective are face masks in preventing the spread of a virus?		
Yes. Face masks reduce the spread of viral respiratory infection. N95 respirators and surgical masks both provide substantial protection (compared with no mask), and surgical masks provide greater protection than cloth masks.		

What is the effectiveness of different types of masks in preventing the transmission of viruses?		
A previous study showed that 2-ply cotton masks are ineffective in preventing respiratory viral infections (RVI) (2), while other studies have demonstrated efficacy of the medical masks in decreasing RVI (3, 4).		

Can a mask effectively block the transmission of a virus?		
A few studies have considered the filtration efficiency of homemade masks made with different types of fabric;48–51 however, there is no broad consensus regarding their effectiveness in minimizing disease transmission.52,53 Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that masks and other face coverings are effective in stopping larger droplets, which, although fewer in number compared to the smaller droplets and nuclei, constitute a large fraction of the total volume of the ejected respiratory fluid.		

Can homemade masks provide some level of protection against the transmission of viral particles?		
A 2008 study, however, concluded that while homemade masks may not offer as much protection as surgical masks or N95s, particularly against tiny aerosols, they could still reduce the transmissibility of viral particles by a small but significant amount.
