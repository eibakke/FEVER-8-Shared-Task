The claim also states that COVID-19 will go away if you stop getting tested, it's just the elderly dying, and people are being intentionally infected. However, the QA pairs state that COVID-19 can spread quickly in these communities, and the impact of that spread is great. Testing, particularly of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals, is key to interrupting this spread. The QA pairs also state that due to COVID-19 being a relatively new and understudied disease, the data available is limited. However, from the cases that emerged, it was observed that comorbidities increase the chances of infection. The QA pairs also state that testing of all people for SARS-CoV-2, including those who have no symptoms, who show symptoms of infection such as trouble breathing, fever, sore throat, or loss of the sense of smell and taste, and who may have been exposed to the virus will help prevent the spread of COVID-19 by identifying people who are in need of care in a timely fashion. The QA pairs also state that miscounting from misdiagnosis or under-reporting of COVID-19-related deaths is avoided. Excess mortality data include ‘collateral damage’ from other health conditions, left untreated if the health system is overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases, or by deliberate actions that prioritise patients with COVID-19 over those with other symptoms. Therefore, the claim is refuted.
