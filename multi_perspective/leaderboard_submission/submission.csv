He actually said, maybe we should detonate a nuclear bomb over the Atlantic. By the way, the same stable genius who said the biggest problem we had in the Revolutionary War is we didn’t have enough airports.","What has Donald Trump's stance on climate change been over the years?		
Donald Trump's stated views on global warming have changed over the past seven years or so (we'll leave it to pundits to judge whether they've ""evolved"" or ""devolved"" in that time), as exemplified, on the one hand, by his endorsement of a 2009 letter urging the U.S. government to invest in a ""clean energy economy"" and pass legislation addressing the ""immediate challenge"" of climate change, and, on the other, by his November 2012 tweet stating that ""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.""		

How many times has Donald Trump referred to climate change as a hoax?		
However, over the years Trump hasn't shied away from his skepticism about climate change, and he has referred to it as a hoax many times.		

Did Donald Trump express skepticism about the severity of climate change?		
However, Trump has repeatedly called climate change a ""hoax"" in speeches, tweets and media appearances, and while he hasn’t necessarily repeated the charge that China ""invented"" climate change, he has said as recently as Jan. 18, 2016, that action on climate change ""is done for the benefit of China.""		

What views has Donald Trump expressed about climate change and its potential consequences?		
Donald Trump has reiterated his doubts about climate change, suggesting that the climate could “change back again,” and that climate scientists are politically motivated.

In every conceivable way, the letter contradicts Trump’s current stance on climate policy. On the campaign trail, Trump has said he is “not a big believer in man-made climate change.”		

Does the evidence contradict Trump's views on the relationship between climate change and hurricane frequency/intensity?		
The evidence not only refutes claims that climate change causes more frequent hurricanes, it is conflicted on how climate change affects the intensity of these storms.		

Did President Trump suggest using nuclear bombs to disrupt the course of hurricanes headed for the US?		
Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump has floated multiple times the idea of thwarting hurricanes headed for the US by bombing them, including by dropping nuclear bombs on hurricanes to disrupt their course, Axios reported Sunday, citing conversations with sources who heard Trump's comments and were briefed on a National Security Council memo that recorded the comments.

13,Wearing face masks will stop the spread of covid 19,"What is the effectiveness of wearing face masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19?		
Among the most effective preventative behaviors is face mask wearing, which has been extensively supported to reduce airborne transmission of viruses (Leung et al., 2020; O'Dowd et al., 2020); however, many people are resistant to face mask wearing despite the effectiveness of the practice, which poses extreme risks in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic (Howard, 2020; Lyu & Wehby, 2020).		

Does wearing face masks have a significant effect on the spread of COVID-19?		
Finding out whether face masks indeed reduce the spread of COVID-19 is thus important. Against the available evidence from clinical studies or previous pandemics, we ask: Can we identify a significant effect of face masks on the spread of COVID-19 by looking at the development of registered COVID-19 cases?		

Can wearing face masks help reduce the transmission of COVID-19?		
Studies of face masks to reduce transmission of influenza or ILI in households or schools have suggested that adherence with wearing face masks may play an important role in determining their effectiveness31,46, although further research is needed.		

Do face masks help prevent the spread of COVID-19?		
Face masks, among other measures such as isolation, quarantine, lockdowns, social distancing and vaccination, have been used for prevention in a wide range of disease outbreaks and medical settings, and there is currently a general consensus that surgical and cloth masks help prevent infected individuals from spreading coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).2,3 Surprisingly, given the logic of their utility, there is less of a consensus that surgical/cloth masks also protect the wearer and many government health organizations did not initially recommend wearing them during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.4,5		

Does wearing face masks reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in community settings?		
This rapid review identified seven observational studies in community settings that compared wearing face masks with not wearing face masks on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, with six studies suggesting that wearing masks may reduce the risk of transmission.		

Can wearing face masks reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection?		
Previous studies on the use of face masks by healthy people in the community have considered other respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-1, influenza, or influenza-like illness (ILI), and have provided some weak evidence that face masks may reduce the risk of infection, particularly when implemented early, combined with hand hygiene and subject to good levels of compliance26–35.		

Does wearing face masks reduce the transmission of COVID-19?		
Recent research has shown that face masks could reduce the transmission of the virus (28, 29), resulting in many governments advising or mandating the use of masks for healthy individuals in the community.		

Does the evidence support the claim that wearing face masks will stop the spread of COVID-19?		
National and international public health guidance on the use of face masks is based on low certainty direct evidence of clinical effectiveness, indirect evidence that supports plausibility of effectiveness, as well as a consideration that SARS-CoV-2 appears to be more infectious than many other respiratory pathogens, including during the presymptomatic phase of the disease44, highlighting the necessity of considering a range of infection prevention and control measures, including face masks, to reduce the spread of infection.		

What is the effectiveness of wearing face masks in reducing the transmission of COVID-19?		
Studies show that face coverings are highly effective in reducing transmission of COVID-19, and high levels of cloth face covering adoption may prevent asymptomatic or presymptomatic carriers from unknowingly infecting others.		

What percentage of infection risk was reduced by wearing face masks?		
Face masks (surgical type) reduced infection risk by 85%. Since face masks are comparatively cheap and easy to use, they are among the most simple and straight forward means to curb SARS-Cov-2 and Covid-19 transmission (see also [53]).

Proponents of border fences point to the substantial reduction in apprehensions along the San Diego sector as tangible proof that fences succeed in reducing cross-border smuggling and migration where they are constructed.100 Opponents attribute part of the decrease in apprehensions to the increase in manpower and resources in the sector and, pointing to the increase in apprehensions in less-populated sectors, contend that the fence only succeeds in re-routing unauthorized migration and not in stopping it.101		

Does the deployment of barriers in the US have a significant impact on reducing illegal drug, border crossings, and human smuggling activities?		
Published research on the effectiveness of border barriers is limited and offers conflicting results in terms of how much of a role barriers play in deterring unauthorized entry in the U.S.		

Does the evidence suggest that barriers are effective in reducing the number of unauthorized border crossings?		
Border barriers can discourage unauthorized border crossings, but the research is mixed in terms of how much they deter migrants from entering the U.S. without permission.		

Does the deployment of barriers necessarily lead to a decrease in illegal drug, border crossings, and human smuggling activities?		
In this report, we analyze the rationale behind border barriers, discuss the effectiveness of border walls in regards to unauthorized migration, smuggling, and national security, and illustrate the wide-ranging damages that existing walls have inflicted upon border communities, the environment, and the lives of border crossers.		

What is the effect of the border fence on the routes taken by illegal immigrants?		
The U.S. Border Patrol itself has admitted that some of this change in illegal immigration patterns has stemmed from increased tactical infrastructure along the border, as the now largely complete border fence pushes illegal immigrants toward less populated and more dangerous areas.[85]

The results speak for themselves: illegal drug, border crossings, and human smuggling activities have decreased in areas where barriers are deployed.		

What is the effect of deploying barriers on illegal activities at the US border?		
Considerable evidence shows that the USBP's historical strategy of ""Prevention through Deterrence,"" whereby agents and resources including border fencing and other barriers have been concentrated along urban areas and areas traditionally featuring high levels of illegal entry, has succeeded in changing the flow of illegal migration.		

What is the relationship between the deployment of barriers and the decrease in illegal drug, border crossings, and human smuggling activities in the United States?		
This in turn suggests that fewer unauthorized aliens are attempting to cross the border in the San Diego sector as a result of the increased enforcement measures, including fencing, manpower, and other resources, that were deployed to that sector.

16,The plentiful evidence we have indicates that masks would not meaningfully help with aerosol transmission of COVID 19.,"Can wearing a face mask be effective in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 if people do not comply with wearing them or if it leads to increased contact due to a false sense of security?		
Even though there is now significant agreement in the medical literature that respiratory transmission of COVID-19 is the dominant vector (Meyerowitz et al. 2020), and many clinical studies have shown that face masks reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and similar illnesses (Chu et al. 2020, Prather et al. 2020, Leung et al. 2020, Greenhalgh et al. 2020), a face mask mandate may not be effective in practice if it fails to increase the prevalence of mask wearing (compliance), or if it leads to increased contact due to a false sense of security.		

Do N95 masks provide a significant benefit in preventing the transmission of COVID-19 compared to surgical masks?		
Although surgical masks have lower filtration efficiency than N95 respirators, observational studies have shown no significant benefit of N95 masks over surgical masks for prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (odds ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.22-3.33) or other respiratory viruses (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.85-1.08).3 For health care workers, routine care for a patient with COVID-19 if both are wearing surgical masks is not considered to be a high-risk occupational exposure.3 Yet, SARS-CoV-2 viral particles have been identified in the air for several hours after an aerosolizing event simulated in a laboratory and near air vents in a clinical setting.3 A group of 239 scientists recently signed an open letter urging the World Health Organization and other international public health bodies to recommend additional precautions (though not N95 masks specifically) to protect against potential airborne transmission, highlighting several recent superspreading events in which SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurred in poorly ventilated areas.5 These instances raise concern for the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission; however, the viability and infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in aerosol form remains unknown.		

Does the evidence suggest that masks are effective in reducing the transmission of COVID-19?		
However, a recent study in patients with seasonal coronaviruses has demonstrated that surgical face masks significantly reduced detection of viral RNA in aerosols and shows a trend in reducing viral RNA in droplets.4 A recent meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials also showed that surgical masks are as effective as N95 masks in reducing transmission of influenza‐like diseases.6 If the result from a case–control study during the SARS‐CoV‐1 outbreak in Hong Kong is any indication, frequent masks use (mainly surgical) in public places can be protective by 64%.7		

Do the results of studies that support the hypothesis that face masks are effective in reducing the presence of viral particles in droplets and aerosol generated by symptomatic SARS-CoV-2–infected individuals contradict the claim that masks would not meaningfully help with aerosol transmission of COVID-19?		
[9]. The need for universal use of cloth face coverings or, when available, of surgical masks seems further suggested by the results of some studies that support the hypothesis that face masks are effective in reducing the presence of viral particles in droplets and aerosol generated by symptomatic SARS-CoV-2–infected individuals [10].		

Does the evidence suggest that masks are effective in reducing the transmission of COVID-19?		
The use of face masks can be effective at reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-21, 2. Theoretical studies show that the extent of disease outbreaks is dependent on population compliance with mask usage and effectiveness of the masks at reducing viral transmission3.		

Does the evidence from the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine support the claim that masks would not meaningfully help with aerosol transmission of COVID-19?		
Limited, indirect evidence from lab studies suggests that homemade fabric masks may capture large respiratory droplets, but there is no evidence they impede the transmission of aerosols implicated in the spread of COVID-19, according to a paper published yesterday by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.		

Is there any scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of masks in controlling the transmission of COVID-19?		
There is no published randomized controlled trial to advocate mask usage as an effective strategy for control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, although various studies have tried to indirectly assess the efficacy of masks against spread of various respiratory infections.		

How effective are masks in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 through aerosols?		
Medical masks have demonstrated their ability to reduce detection of influenza virus RNA in respiratory droplets and coronavirus RNA in aerosols, with a trend towards reduced detection of coronavirus RNA in respiratory droplets.10 Non-medical masks, on the other hand, are as much as three time less effective in the control of emission of microorganisms.11		

Does the use of surgical masks prevent the transmission of COVID-19?		
Importantly, no documented SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks have been linked to settings in which surgical masks were assiduously used in lieu of N95 masks, which suggests that even if airborne transmission is a considerable contributor to SARS-CoV-2 transmission, surgical masks are likely sufficient to prevent it.3 Because the infectious dose of virus required to cause clinical infection also remains unknown, it is possible that blocking most, even if not all, viral particles through masks with lower filtration efficiencies of submicron particles is sufficient to prevent disease in the vast majority of cases.		

Can face masks prevent the transmission of COVID-19?		
Another study, “Respiratory virus shedding in exhaled breath and efficacy of face masks”, published in Nature Research on 3 April, found that face masks could prevent the transmission of human coronaviruses by filtering respiratory droplets.

Which New York City publication was the first to endorse Donald Trump's bid for re-election?		
The Post is the second major local New York City publication to come down on Trump's side.

33,"America went from 75,000 flu deaths last year in 2019 to almost 0 in 2020","Did the number of flu deaths in the US decrease in 2020 compared to the previous year?		
During the same period, flu accounted for an estimated 24,000 to 62,000 deaths in the country. The overall dynamic of the 2019-2020 flu season is comparable to previous years, with the exception of a sharper than usual drop in cases in April.		

What was the actual number of flu-related deaths reported in the US during week 15 of 2020?		
During week 15 of 2020, 380 flu-related deaths, not zero, were reported. The trajectory of deaths during the 2019-2020 flu season is similar to the curves in previous years, with the possible exception of the 2017-2018 season, which was particularly deadly (Figure 2).		

What was the estimated number of flu-related deaths in the United States during the 2019-2020 flu season?		
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the flu was responsible for an estimated 38,000 deaths in the United States alone during the 2016-2017 flu season, and an even greater number were hospitalized with the illness.		

What was the number of flu deaths in America in 2020 compared to the previous year?		
The flu season was particularly severe last year, meaning the drop in influenza deaths from 2019 to 2020 is even more pronounced.		

What was the estimated number of flu deaths in the United States during the 2019-2020 influenza season, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)?		
Preliminary data suggests there were an estimated 24,000-62,000 flu deaths for the 2019-20 influenza season, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).		

Did the CDC's annual estimates of flu deaths in 2020 substantially overstate the actual number of deaths caused by influenza?		
Based on the figure of approximately 60 000 COVID-19 deaths in the US as of the end of April 2020, this ratio suggests only a 1.0-fold to 2.6-fold change from the CDC-estimated seasonal influenza deaths calculated during the previous 7 full seasons.3 From our analysis, we infer that either the CDC’s annual estimates substantially overstate the actual number of deaths caused by influenza or that the current number of COVID-19 counted deaths substantially understates the actual number of deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2, or both.		

How many flu deaths were there in America in the 2018-2019 flu season?		
From October 2018 to May 2019 the FluSurv-NET data accounted for about 7,000 influenza-associated deaths, which CDC ultimately used to estimate 34,200 total deaths for the 2018-2019 flu season.		

What was the number of flu-associated deaths among children in the United States during the 2019-2020 flu season?		
Since flu-associated deaths in children became a nationally notifiable condition in 2004, the total number of flu-associated deaths among children during one season has ranged from 37 (during the 2011-2012 season) to 186 (during the 2017-18 season, as of April 19, 2019); this excludes the 2009 pandemic, when 358 pediatric deaths from April 15, 2009 through October 2, 2010 were reported to CDC.		

What is the basis for the claim that America went from 75,000 flu deaths last year in 2019 to almost 0 in 2020, given that clinical laboratories did record cases of flu and flu-related deaths during the 2019-2020 season?		
In summary, clinical laboratories did record cases of flu and flu-related deaths during the 2019-2020 season, as well as during the two weeks preceding the time when this claim was posted (weeks 14 and 15).		

How did the number of flu deaths in America compare to the five-year average in 2020?

44,Deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at “pox parties” could be a good way to help create herd immunity against COVID-19 without a vaccine.,"Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a recommended method for creating herd immunity against COVID-19?		
Herd immunity for COVID-19 through natural infection can pose many challenges. COVID-19 can cause serious complications and millions of deaths, therefore the experts recommend trying to achieve herd immunity through vaccination.		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a recommended method for creating herd immunity against COVID-19?		
Herd immunity against COVID-19 should be achieved by protecting people through vaccination, not by exposing them to the pathogen that causes the disease.		

Are ""pox parties"" where children are intentionally infected with COVID-19 being considered as a potential method to create herd immunity against COVID-19?		
Controversial 'pox parties' which see children intentionally infected with diseases to build immunity could become popular if Covid-19 vaccine does not come to the rescue, scientist says		

According to the World Health Organization, what is the recommended method for achieving herd immunity against COVID-19?		
WHO supports achieving 'herd immunity' through vaccination, not by allowing a disease to spread through any segment of the population, as this would result in unnecessary cases and deaths.		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a scientifically supported method for creating herd immunity against COVID-19?		
However, according to the World Health Organization, “Attempts to reach herd immunity through exposing people to a virus are scientifically problematic and morally unethical.”		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a scientifically supported method for creating herd immunity against COVID-19?		
Managing COVID-19 by allowing herd immunity to develop in low-risk populations while protecting the most vulnerable is ""a dangerous fallacy unsupported by the scientific evidence,"" warn an international group of 80 researchers in an open letter.		

Is deliberately infecting children with COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a viable alternative to vaccination for achieving herd immunity?		
A vaccine for the virus that causes COVID-19 would be an ideal approach to achieving herd immunity. Vaccines create immunity without causing illness or resulting complications.		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" considered a viable method for creating herd immunity against COVID-19 without a vaccine?		
Pursuing herd immunity deliberately now seems more ethically dubious than ever for elected officials, Bauer says, given that individual recovery from COVID-19 also appears to be a fraught process.		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a viable method for creating herd immunity against COVID-19 without a vaccine?		
Achieving natural immunity, an unfavorable outcome by any measure, would mean exposing susceptible groups to a debilitating and potentially fatal disease—meaning more people could die in the process of achieving herd immunity.		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a recommended method for creating herd immunity against COVID-19 without a vaccine?

45,Cutting the umbilical cord straight away deliberately denies the baby natural immunity so that medical professionals have a reason to vaccinate and medicate them.,"Does delaying the clamping of the umbilical cord increase the baby's iron stores and haemoglobin concentrations?		
A more liberal approach to delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in healthy term infants appears to be warranted, particularly in light of growing evidence that delayed cord clamping increases early haemoglobin concentrations and iron stores in infants.		

Does cutting the umbilical cord immediately after birth have any benefits for the baby's health?		
Delayed umbilical cord clamping appears to be beneficial for term and preterm infants. In term infants, delayed umbilical cord clamping increases hemoglobin levels at birth and improves iron stores in the first several months of life, which may have a favorable effect on developmental outcomes.		

What are the benefits of delayed cord clamping after delivery?		
Delayed cord clamping (anytime beyond 60 seconds after delivery) has benefits to the baby. This is because delayed cord clamping allows more blood to transfer from the placenta to the infant, which increases the baby’s red blood cells and iron stores, and reduces the risk of anemia.		

Does cutting the umbilical cord immediately after birth deny the baby natural immunity?		
There is growing evidence that delayed cord clamping is beneficial and can improve the infant's iron status for up to 6 months after birth.		

Does immediate cord clamping provide any benefits to the newborn?		
Delayed cord clamping provides more placental transfusion between the placenta and the newborn, whereas immediate cord clamping allows for immediate resuscitation of the premature newborn by a neonatologist (193).		

Does cutting the umbilical cord immediately after birth cause harm to the baby?		
It has now been shown to provide no benefit to the mother and to result in harm to the neonate. The clinical trial evidence relating to delayed cord clamping compared to immediate cord clamping is presented and the physiological rationale for delayed cord clamping is discussed in this paper.		

Does immediate umbilical cord clamping have any benefits for the baby's health?		
Term and preterm infants appear to derive benefit from delayed umbilical cord clamping; therefore, delayed umbilical cord clamping for at least 30–60 seconds is recommended in term and preterm infants except when immediate umbilical cord clamping is necessary because of neonatal or maternal indications.		

Does delayed umbilical cord clamping provide any benefits to the baby?		
However, the authors concluded that given the benefit of delayed umbilical cord clamping in term infants, delayed cord clamping is beneficial overall, provided that the obstetrician–gynecologist or other obstetric care provider has the ability to monitor and treat jaundice.		

What is the current understanding of the optimal timing for umbilical cord clamping in newborns, and what are the implications for their natural immunity and subsequent medical treatment?		
Although many randomized controlled trials that involved term and preterm infants have compared the benefits of delayed umbilical clamping with those of immediate cord clamping, the ideal timing for umbilical cord clamping in specific circumstances warrants further investigation.		

Is delayed cord clamping the standard practice for full-term births?		
Delayed cord clamping is not standard medical practice in full-term births. The standard of care in obstetrics right now only calls for delayed cord clamping with premature babies who are more in need of the increase in blood volume compared to full-term babies.

46,The umbilical cord should not be cut until 1 hour after birth or they baby will not have enough blood right after birth.,"What are the benefits and risks of delayed cord clamping after birth?		
Delayed cord clamping, defined as waiting to clamp the umbilical cord for one to three minutes after birth or until cord pulsation has ceased, is associated with benefits in term infants, including higher birth weight, higher hemoglobin concentration, improved iron stores at six months, and improved respiratory transition.35 Benefits are even greater with preterm infants.36 However, delayed cord clamping is associated with an increase in jaundice requiring phototherapy.35 Delayed cord clamping is indicated with all deliveries unless urgent resuscitation is needed.		

What are the benefits of delayed umbilical cord clamping for newborn babies?		
Delayed umbilical cord clamping appears to be beneficial for term and preterm infants. In term infants, delayed umbilical cord clamping increases hemoglobin levels at birth and improves iron stores in the first several months of life, which may have a favorable effect on developmental outcomes.		

Is it recommended to delay cutting the umbilical cord after birth?		
Delaying cord clamping for at least 30–60 seconds after delivery is recommended by national and international organizations.1–6 In term newborns, delayed cord clamping has been shown to increase blood volume,7		

Does delaying the clamping of the umbilical cord increase the amount of blood in a baby after birth?		
A more liberal approach to delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in healthy term infants appears to be warranted, particularly in light of growing evidence that delayed cord clamping increases early haemoglobin concentrations and iron stores in infants.		

Does the World Health Organization recommend waiting at least 1 minute after birth to cut the umbilical cord?		
Despite the available evidence that delayed umbilical cord clamping is more beneficial to infants, as well as the existence of 2014 WHO recommendation that the umbilical cord should be clamped between 1 and 3 minutes, its implementation is still low in many countries including Tanzania.		

Is immediate umbilical cord clamping necessary for a baby's blood supply right after birth?		
Term and preterm infants appear to derive benefit from delayed umbilical cord clamping; therefore, delayed umbilical cord clamping for at least 30–60 seconds is recommended in term and preterm infants except when immediate umbilical cord clamping is necessary because of neonatal or maternal indications.		

What is the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommendation for the timing of umbilical cord clamping after birth?		
Recommendations for when to clamp and cut the cord differ. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) advises waiting 30 to 60 seconds after the birth of a preterm infant, but acknowledges there is insufficient evidence to support delayed cord clamping in full-term infants born in areas that do not lack resources.		

What is the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommendation regarding the timing of umbilical cord clamping after birth?		
Delayed cord clamping appears to be helpful for both full-term and preterm babies. For this reason, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends delayed cord clamping for at least 30 to 60 seconds after birth for most babies.		

Does delaying the clamping of the umbilical cord after birth increase the infant's blood volume?		
Traditionally, practitioners have clamped the umbilical cord immediately after birth. Previous studies have shown that delaying cord clamping results in a 20 to 30 percent increase in an infant’s blood volume.		

What was the standard practice for umbilical cord clamping before 1960?		
Until 1960, delayed umbilical cord clamping (DCC) to promote placental transfusion was common; afterward, cord clamping immediately after birth became standard practice to reduce the risk of postpartum hemorrhage, although without evidence (1, 2).

In its 2018 review, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority concluded that ""despite the lack of established mechanism[s] for affecting health with weak radio wave exposure there is however need for more research covering the novel frequency domains, used for 5G."" In August 2019, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced that the commission proposes to maintain its current RF exposure safety standards (adopted in 1996), quoting a statement from the Director of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health that ""[t]he available scientific evidence to date does not support adverse health effects in humans due to exposures at or under the current limits.""		

What are the health concerns associated with 5G technology, as reported by Scientific American magazine?		
5G technology raises certain public health concerns. The health effects of radiofrequency (RF) radiation have been the subject of numerous studies, with mixed results.		

Is there evidence that 5G poses health risks similar to those associated with 3G and 4G cell phones?		
Research has shown health risks associated with 3G and 4G cell phones but there is very little public information about the health effects of higher frequency 5G. Scientists, however, have called for pausing the 5G rollout until more independent research is conducted.		

Is there any evidence that 5G technology poses a risk to human health within the current exposure limits?		
Within current exposure limits, there appears to be little or no risk of adverse health effects related to radiofrequency (RF) exposure from 5G systems, concludes an evidence-based expert review in the June issue of Health Physics, official journal of the Health Physics Society.		

Is there evidence that 5G technology has been classified as a potential carcinogen by a reputable health organization?		
Still, fears persist, in part because of inconclusive studies. Many critics of 5G and other wireless technologies point to the fact that the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer classified mobile phones as ""possibly carcinogenic"" in 2011.		

Does the available scientific evidence support the claim that 5G technology poses health risks to humans?

Does the evidence provided by Scientific American support their claim that 5G technology is not safe?		
By exploiting our background, we analyze the alleged health effects of 5G exposure and critically review the latest works that are often referenced to support the health concerns from 5G. We then precisely examine the up-to-date metrics, regulations, and assessment of compliance procedures for 5G exposure, by evaluating the latest guidelines from IEEE, ICNIRP, ITU, IEC, and FCC, as well as the national regulations in more than 220 countries.

82,In the US lockdowns are partly responsible for excess deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19 which were observed in 2020.,"What percentage of excess deaths in the US during March and April 2020 were attributed to COVID-19?		
The study, “Excess Deaths from COVID-19 and Other Causes, March-April 2020,” showed that only 65% of the excess deaths that occurred in March and April were attributed to COVID-19, meaning more than one-third were linked to other causes.		

Did the study find that COVID-19 deaths accounted for all excess deaths observed in the US during the pandemic, or were there other causes of death that contributed to the excess mortality?		
Previous studies of excess deaths (the gap between observed and expected deaths) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic found that publicly reported COVID-19 deaths underestimated the full death toll, which includes documented and undocumented deaths from the virus and non–COVID-19 deaths caused by disruptions from the pandemic.1,2 A previous analysis found that COVID-19 was cited in only 65% of excess deaths in the first weeks of the pandemic (March-April 2020); deaths from non–COVID-19 causes (eg, Alzheimer disease, diabetes, heart disease) increased sharply in 5 states with the most COVID-19 deaths.1 This study updates through August 1, 2020, the estimate of excess deaths and explores temporal relationships with state reopenings (lifting of coronavirus restrictions).		

What are some possible reasons for the excess deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19 that were observed in 2020, according to the findings?		
The findings provide some support for various hypotheses about non-COVID-19 excess mortality, including undiagnosed COVID-19, reduced use of health services by those that need them, and unintended consequences of measures taken to control the spread of the virus.		

What types of deaths were possibly misclassified or indirectly caused by the pandemic, according to the evidence?		
Finally, estimates of excess deaths attributed to COVID-19 might underestimate the actual number directly attributable to COVID-19, because deaths from other causes might represent misclassified COVID-19–related deaths or deaths indirectly caused by the pandemic.		

What causes of death may have been reduced due to the COVID-19 lockdown in the US in 2020?		
mortality. Because the COVID-19 lockdown may have reduced deaths from some causes, such as 		

Can excess death data accurately account for indirect effects of the COVID-19 outbreak, such as depression and other mental health challenges?		
Excess death data, which compares the deaths counted during a specific time period to average deaths during that period in previous years, can help to show a picture of the true impact of an event by accounting for not only deaths directly from COVID, but also those that may have resulted from the indirect effects of the outbreak, such as depression and other mental health challenges due to hardships or an unwillingness or fear of seeking care for other medical issues.[xxvii]		

What is the possible reason for the observed excess deaths in the US in 2020 that were not directly attributed to COVID-19?		
additional excess deaths, not directly attributed to COVID-19, may be due to underreporting in the early phases of the		

What types of deaths, aside from those directly attributed to COVID-19, were observed in the US in 2020 due to disruptions in healthcare services during the lockdowns?		
The additional deaths identified in the excess mortality analysis include unconfirmed COVID-19 deaths as well as deaths from other conditions that occur due to disruptions in health care services.		

What is the estimated number of excess deaths in the US in 2020 that were not directly attributed to COVID-19, according to the evidence?		
The disproportional impact of the recession on low-income groups suggests that the indirect mortality attributable to the lockdowns and other COVID-19-mitigating measures may be closer to the more pessimistic projections and higher end of our lives lost estimates, close to 250,000 deaths and 9 million years of lost human lifespan.		

What percentage of excess all-cause deaths in 2020 in the US were not directly attributed to COVID-19?		
The number of excess all-cause deaths was 28% higher than those of COVID-19 deaths. They noted that,“the deaths officially attributed to COVID-19 accounted for 78% of the excess all-cause deaths, leaving 22% unattributed to COVID-19.

124,PTFE Sprayed On Blue Masks Causes Symptoms Similar To COVID-19,"What symptoms can be caused by exposure to heated PTFE particles?		
The respiratory effects of PTFE are usually focused on acute toxicity. Heated PTFE particles may cause symptoms that range from mild flu-like symptoms to severe symptoms, such as pulmonary edema [11, 12].		

Can inhaling PTFE fumes cause flu-like symptoms?		
Numerous case studies in the 1900s have documented flu-like symptoms after inhalation of PTFE fumes by workers in PTFE-using factories and by people overheating non-stick pans in the kitchen.		

What health effects can occur from long-term exposure to PTFE particles, such as those found in blue masks?		
This case demonstrates that long-term exposure to PTFE spraying can cause granulomatous lung lesions such as pneumoconiosis; such lesions appear to be caused not by the degradation products of PTFE from high temperatures but by spraying the particles of PTFE.		

What are the potential health risks associated with exposure to PTFE, particularly in relation to respiratory health?		
Furthermore, no time-weighted average or short-term exposure limit is suggested for PTFE. Acute and chronic pulmonary diseases caused by PTFE have been reported, and further studies should be conducted to recognize toxicity and establish an exposure limit for PTFE.		

Is PFOA, a chemical used in the manufacturing process of PTFE, considered potentially carcinogenic by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?		
This is a synthetic chemical that was used in small amounts to create PTFE. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is investigating whether PFOA is carcinogenic, as there have been health and environmental concerns over the manufacturing process of PTFE and chemicals such as PFOA that are used to make it.

126,"Ulysses S. Grant, commander of the Union Army during the American Civil War, was a slave owner.","Did Ulysses S. Grant personally own slaves during his lifetime?		
As a result, Ulysses Grant was the last U.S. president to have owned an enslaved individual. Grant’s legacy as the respected Commanding General of the Union Army, and his efforts as president to protect black citizenship have long obscured his personal slave-ownership, as well as that of his beloved wife.		

When did Ulysses S. Grant free his slave, William Jones?		
At some time before the Civil War, Grant himself owned a slave named William Jones. We know this not because the Grant correspondence mentions it, as his letters up until the Civil War do not mention his opinions on slavery nor discuss the status of slaves, but because he manumitted Jones on March 29, 1859.		

Did Ulysses S. Grant actually own slaves, according to the historical record?		
The proponents of the myth that Ulysses S. Grant owned slaves during the War do so to obscure the historical record that the overwhelming reason given by southerners for seceding from the Union was to protect the institution of slavery, an institution that had expanded beyond southern borders.		

How many slaves did Ulysses S. Grant own in his lifetime?		
The perhaps surprising answer is Ulysses S. Grant. As far as is known, Grant owned only one slave in his lifetime, and he freed that slave even though at the time Grant was in a dire financial situation and could have made some much needed money by selling his slave.		

Did Ulysses S. Grant ever own slaves?		
While Grant’s views on slavery evolved over time, his relationship with slavery was complicated and demonstrates the pervasiveness of the institution in antebellum America.

Grant came to own that slave through his wife’s family. When Ulysses Grant and Julia Dent married on August 22, 1848, Grant was pursuing a military career, having recently returned from the Mexican-American War.		

Did Ulysses S. Grant own slaves?		
The book documents Grant’s difficult relationship with his father-in-law, which was partly due to their disagreement over the subject of slavery, and which led the latter to refuse to give his daughter the title to her slaves for fear his son-in-law would emancipate them.		

Did Ulysses S. Grant own slaves at any point in his life?		
Grant had worked Hardscrabble with slaves supplied by his father-in-law, and Julia continued to own slaves during the Civil War; but Grant freed one slave he owned himself in 1859, at a time when he desperately needed the money that sale of a slave could bring.		

Did Ulysses S. Grant initially prioritize the abolition of slavery as a goal of the American Civil War?		
Grant’s father, Jesse, was staunchly anti-slavery, but early in the Civil War Ulysses Grant asserted in a letter to his father that the main goal of the war was to restore the Union.		

Did Ulysses S. Grant have a clear stance against slavery before and during the American Civil War?		
Grant’s father, Jesse, was firmly anti-slavery. However, his son’s attitudes toward slavery were more ambivalent, at least from what we can discern of his opinions before and during the Civil War.

137,it is unknown whether a person under 20 can pass the disease to an older adult.,"Is there an age gradient in terms of transmission risk from children to adults?		
There is new evidence, including from a recent comprehensive study from South Korea, suggesting there is an age gradient in terms of transmission risk from children, meaning younger children (<10 years old) are less likely to transmit compared to adults, while older children (10 and older) may transmit at levels similar to adults.		

Can people under the age of 20 potentially pass COVID-19 to older adults, despite being at a lower risk of infection themselves?		
Evidence so far indicates that children are at a lower risk of infection, present with milder symptoms, and are much less likely to die from the infection compared to older adults, but they still could present a risk to others in their household, especially in households with people at higher risk, such as older adults and others with pre-existing conditions.		

Does the lower susceptibility of children to SARS-CoV-2 infection imply that they are unable to pass the disease to older adults?		
Preliminary evidence suggests that children have a lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with adults, but the role that children and adolescents play in transmission of this virus remains unclear.		

Can people under 20 years old transmit COVID-19 to older adults?		
Although children and young adults are reportedly at lower risk for severe disease and death from infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), than are persons in other age groups (1), younger persons can experience infection and subsequently transmit infection to those at higher risk for severe illness (2–4).		

Can children under 20 years old transmit the disease to adults?		
Without a doubt transmission from child-to-child and child-to-adult can occur, but a number of studies find children, particularly young children, are less likely to be source of infection in households and other settings, compared to adults.		

Is it possible for a person under 20 to pass COVID-19 to an older adult?		
Therefore, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from children is plausible. Considering the relatively low frequency of infected children, even in severely affected areas, biological or other unknown factors could lead to the lower transmission in this population.		

Is it more or less likely for a person under 20 to transmit the disease to an older adult compared to an adult of the same age?		
There is some evidence for an age gradient in infectiousness, with younger children less likely and older children more likely to transmit at levels similar to adults.		

Is it possible that children under 20 may be able to pass the disease to older adults, despite the low number of recorded cases in this age group?		
According to a study recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, for instance, less than 1 percent of recorded COVID-19 cases in China were in children younger than 10.11 However, one credible hypothesis is simply that children develop symptoms less frequently because their body reacts better to the virus once they get infected, rather than because they get infected less frequently.12,13 More research needs to be done on this, but if that were the case, it would mean that children are very subtle vectors of the disease.		

Can people under the age of 20 transmit the disease to older adults?		
Given the role of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission (2), all persons, including young adults, should take extra precautions to avoid transmission to family and community members who are older or who have underlying medical conditions.		

Can a person under 20 years old pass COVID-19 to an older adult?		
Because persons with asymptomatic and mild disease, including children, are likely playing a role in transmission and spread of COVID-19 in the community, social distancing and everyday preventive behaviors are recommended for persons of all ages to slow the spread of the virus, protect the health care system from being overloaded, and protect older adults and persons of any age with serious underlying medical conditions.

139,A campaign ad video for John Cornyn says that his plan would guarantee insurers must sell plans to any patient with preexisting conditions and will be covered in his plan.,"Does John Cornyn's plan align with the views of the majority of Americans regarding pre-existing conditions?		
A majority of Americans favor retaining the provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that prohibit insurers from denying coverage or charging more to people with preexisting health conditions.1 In fact, a proposed Senate bill, the Republican-backed Ensuring Coverage for Patients with Pre-Existing Conditions Act, would maintain certain provisions under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that prevent insurers from refusing coverage to people or varying premiums based on whether they have a preexisting condition.2		

How does John Cornyn's plan compare to the current Republican legislative proposal regarding coverage for pre-existing conditions?		
- Issue: A current Republican legislative proposal would permit insurers to offer plans that exclude coverage of treatment for preexisting health conditions, even while the bill would maintain the Affordable Care Act’s rule prohibiting denial of coverage to people with a preexisting condition.		

What specific health conditions would be covered under John Cornyn's plan?		
While the Ensuring Coverage for Patients with Pre-Existing Conditions Act maintains the ACA’s provisions that require insurers to enroll individuals with preexisting conditions, the proposed bill would not require that the conditions themselves be covered.		

How does John Cornyn's plan differ from the Affordable Care Act in terms of coverage for pre-existing conditions?		
However, in contrast with the ACA, the proposed legislation would permit insurers to sell plans that entirely exclude coverage for treatment of an enrolled individual’s preexisting condition (Exhibit 1).3 Prior to the ACA’s implementation in 2014, plans sold in the individual market often incorporated such coverage exclusions.4		

Does John Cornyn's plan offer the same level of protection as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in regards to pre-existing conditions?		
Republicans in Congress have suggested legislation that would protect those with pre-existing conditions, but those bills have not offered the same, groundbreaking level of protection Obamacare provides: that a patient's current health could not be considered by insurance companies doling out plans, so people are not charged more or denied care because of their health.		

How would John Cornyn's plan protect patients with pre-existing conditions?		
This bill would prevent insurers from refusing or varying premiums based on preexisting conditions. But, unlike the ACA, this bill would allow insurers to sell plans that entirely exclude coverage for care pertaining to the preexisting conditions themselves.		

Does John Cornyn's plan require insurers to sell plans to patients with pre-existing conditions?		
Providing comprehensive protections to people with pre-existing conditions, as the ACA does, requires outlawing a variety of insurance practices that were common before the law took full effect in 2014, including:		

Does John Cornyn's plan ensure that people with pre-existing conditions will be able to purchase health insurance?		
The ACA's provision on preexisting conditions has survived many challenges. Public officials of both major political parties have expressed commitment to the issue and have offered various plans to protect Americans with preexisting conditions from being denied coverage.		

Does John Cornyn's plan guarantee that insurers must sell plans to any patient with pre-existing conditions as stated in his campaign ad video?		
- Eliminate or weaken protections for people with pre-existing conditions by allowing states to waive the ACA’s prohibition against charging higher premiums based on health status and the requirement that insurers cover essential health benefits including mental health, substance abuse treatment, and maternity care.		

Does John Cornyn's plan guarantee that people with pre-existing conditions will not be charged higher premiums?		
Unfortunately, their approach to addressing the needs of people with pre-existing conditions is modeled on one that has failed in several state efforts in recent decades: The new law includes an outright ban on insurers' excluding pre-existing conditions from coverage, and on insurers' requiring people with higher health risks to pay higher premiums (older enrollees would still pay more than younger ones, up to a point).

Did Senate President Vicente Sotto III attribute the COVID-19 cases in the Philippines to a particular group of Filipinos?		
According to Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque, the opposition is “resorting to politicking” in saying that the government failed to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, noting how the country beat the University of the Philippines’ projection of 3.5-million cases (Aguilar, 2020).

180,"Dr. Ebeneezer, a medical doctor and a herbal practitioner at the Amuzu Hospital has instructed men to have sex at least 21 times a month to avoid prostate cancer.","Is there an inverse relationship between ejaculation frequency and the risk of prostate cancer?		
Background: Evidence suggests that ejaculation frequency may be inversely related to the risk of prostate cancer (PCa), a disease for which few modifiable risk factors have been identified.		

Does frequent ejaculation, as suggested by Dr. Ebeneezer, have a link to prostate cancer risk?		
The notion that sexual activity might affect prostate cancer risk has been controversial. A meta-analysis published in 2002 reported that increased ejaculation frequency and having more sexual partners were associated with prostate cancer risk, but age at first intercourse was not.		

Does frequent ejaculation decrease the risk of prostate cancer?		
Having a greater frequency of ejaculations did not increase prostate cancer risk. On the contrary, very frequent ejaculations might decrease total prostate cancer and organ-confined cancer risk.		

How often does ejaculation need to occur to lower the risk of developing prostate cancer?		
Although the study found out frequent ejaculation appeared to lower the risk of developing prostate cancer, it is unclear how ejaculation may affect men destined to develop or already in the early stages of prostate cancer.		

Does Dr. Ebenezer recommend a specific number of times for men to have sex per month to avoid prostate cancer?		
Overall however, they found only weak evidence that ejaculatory frequency reduced advanced prostate cancer risk for men in their 40s, which was not modified by number of new sexual partners.		

Does frequent sexual activity, as recommended by Dr. Ebeneezer, have a relationship with prostate cancer risk, and if so, does it vary by age group?		
Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in men. In January 2009, a study reported that frequent masturbation by men in their 20s was associated with an increased risk of developing prostate cancer, but that it lowered the risk for men in their 50s.		

Does frequent ejaculation have a link to a reduced risk of prostate cancer?		
""This large prospective study provides the strongest evidence to date of a beneficial role of ejaculation in prevention of prostate cancer,"" write the researchers, led by Jennifer Rider, ScD, MPH, a cancer epidemiologist at the Boston University School of Public Health.		

Does Dr. Ebeneezer's claim that frequent ejaculation prevents prostate cancer have any scientific backing from the NHS?		
However, the NHS emphasised that this conclusion did not prove that frequent ejaculation prevents cancer, purely that it is correlated with a reduced risk.		

Does Dr. Ebeneezer's recommendation of having sex at least 21 times a month have any scientific basis in relation to reducing the risk of prostate cancer?		
Some studies have suggested that more physically active men may have a lower risk of prostate cancer — or prostate cancer progression — than sedentary men, but the results have been less clear-cut than with other prostate-related conditions.		

Is there a correlation between frequent ejaculation and a reduced risk of prostate cancer?		
A research team led by Professor Graham Giles, Director of the Cancer Council's Cancer Epidemiology Centre, has found that there is evidence that the more frequently men ejaculate between the ages of 20 and 50, the less likely they are to develop prostate cancer.

192,It makes no sense for oil to be cheaper in Nigeria than in Saudi Arabia.,"How much does it cost to produce a barrel of oil in Canada?		
Meanwhile, the location and size of Saudi's oil fields also help keep its production costs down.

Why does Nigeria's oil trade at a lower price than Saudi Arabia's despite having lower oil reserves?		
Canada's oil sands represent the third largest reserves in the world after Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, but its crude trades at a substantial discount to other North American grades due to its low quality and limited pipeline access to market.

Trump clearly exacerbated this polarization, however, with his inflammatory rhetoric, his discrediting of political rivals, and his open contempt for institutional checks on executive power.

Donald Trump’s presidency, as it unfolds, amplifies these doubts. First as a candidate and now as president, Trump openly derides core institutions of democratic governance: the independent press, the judiciary, the bureaucracy, the validity of elections, the legitimacy of democratic contestation, and the centrality of facts to political discourse.

Considering that a large number of cases are asymptomatic (or present with very mild symptoms) and that testing has not been performed on the entire population, only a fraction of the SARS-CoV-2 infected population is detected, confirmed through a laboratory test, and officially reported as a COVID-19 case.		

Did Donald Trump suggest that the number of COVID-19 cases should be reduced by slowing down the testing process?		
Similarly, despite public health officials unanimously endorsing the need for widespread COVID-19 testing to contain the spread of the virus, Trump blamed testing itself for the rapidly rising number of COVID-19 cases and stated at a campaign rally that he told officials to “slow the testing down, please.”		

How does the claim that COVID-19 will go away if people stop getting tested relate to the evidence that testing, particularly of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals, is key to interrupting the spread of COVID-19?		
Therefore, COVID-19 can spread quickly in these communities, and the impact of that spread is great. Testing, particularly of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals, is key to interrupting this spread.		

Does the claim that COVID-19 will go away if you stop getting tested, it's just the elderly dying and people are being intentionally infected, align with the evidence that comorbidities increase the chances of infection?		
Due to COVID-19 being a relatively new and understudied disease, the data available is limited. However, from the cases that emerged, it was observed that comorbidities increase the chances of infection [7].		

Are older adults the primary demographic experiencing COVID-19 related deaths?		
While we have much to learn yet about the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2, and the COVID-19 disease it causes, evidence to date suggests that deaths among people who have tested positive for the coronavirus are highest at older ages and near zero for young children.		

Does the claim that COVID-19 will go away if you stop getting tested assume that the infection fatality rate is only among those who are tested and symptomatic?		
The infection fatality rate is the proportion of infected people who will die from COVID-19, including those who do not get tested or become symptomatic.		

Is the claim that COVID-19 will go away if people stop getting tested supported by the fact that the virus has been reported among children?		
COVID-19 reported among children. The virus can be fatal in cases, so far mainly among older people 		

Is it possible that the observed lower rate of Covid-19 infection in children is due to biased testing practices rather than a lower susceptibility to the virus?		
Overall global trends seem to suggest children are less likely to be infected than adults, especially older adults, but it is very possible the data is biased by the fact that, in some countries, testing is only offered to those who show up in hospital with severe symptoms of Covid-19, very few of whom are children.		

According to the CDC, can people who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmit the virus to others?		
Although scientists and health care professionals continue to study the spread of COVID-19 to learn more about its presentation, transmission and immunity, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that “a significant portion of individuals with [COVID-19] lack symptoms (“asymptomatic”) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (“pre-symptomatic”) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms.”		

What percentage of people who meet the COVID-19 symptomatic testing criteria are confirmed to have the virus?		
Early data from the United States suggests that in patients meeting the COVID-19 symptomatic testing criteria, about one in five tested were confirmed to have the virus, highlighting the significant overlap with other respiratory illness (though false-negatives can occur for a range of reasons related to both sample collection, storage, and testing limitations).

What are some of the challenges that Cuba faces in terms of health security?		
Health security in Cuba, however, also faces challenges. These concern Cuba's visibility and participation in the broader global health security architecture, the social controls exercised by the state in managing disease threats in Cuban territory, and the resource constraints facing the island-in particular, the effects of the US embargo.		

How has the relationship between the United States and PAHO changed despite Cuba's expulsion from the organization in 1962?

What is the timing of the US pressure on Cuba's 'More Doctors' program in relation to the change in US administration?		
While the Cuban doctors have been criticised in the past, not least by those who say they undercut poor countries’ development of their own healthcare systems and medical training, the current US pressure on the programme coincides with the election of Donald Trump and his apparent determination to reverse the warming of relations between the US and Cuba that took place under the Obama administration.

New Zealand’s use of energy has doubled every 22 years over the past century. While renewable energy has been an important source, particularly because of the use of hydro power for electricity, New Zealand has increasingly relied on non-renewable, fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas.		

Is Judith Collins' claim that New Zealand is using more coal to generate electricity because of the oil and gas exploration ban supported by the evidence that New Zealand's domestic gas and oil reserves have declined over the past 10 years?		
New Zealand’s domestic gas and oil reserves have declined over the past 10 years, and as a result the amount of primary energy supplied by New Zealand oil has decreased.		

Did Judith Collins claim that the oil and gas exploration ban led to an increase in coal consumption in New Zealand?		
The New Zealand government’s ban on new offshore oil and gas exploration has come under fire, with the National Party claiming it has led to increased energy costs and a rise in coal consumption.		

Is the oil and gas exploration ban the primary reason for the increase in coal usage for electricity generation in New Zealand?

Energy Minister David Parker said that wind and geothermal generation are the keys to helping New Zealand switch future electricity production away from fossil fuels used in coal and gas electricity plants.		

Is Judith Collins correct that New Zealand is using more coal to generate electricity due to the oil and gas exploration ban?		
Production of both oil and gas in New Zealand has been consistently dropping in recent years and renewables increase, the ban may simply ensure this trajectory continues.		

Is coal still a significant source of electricity generation in New Zealand?		
Although other forms of energy generation (mainly natural gas and renewables) have increased, coal still accounts for a relatively high share of energy generation in Australia – around 60 per cent in 2018.		

Is the ban on oil and gas exploration in New Zealand leading to an increase in coal consumption for electricity generation?		
This status is likely to continue for some time. Electricity generation consumes about 20 percent of New Zealand’s domestic coal supply, and consumption is unlikely to increase in the future.		

Is Judith Collins correct that New Zealand is using more coal to generate electricity due to the oil and gas exploration ban?		
Coal represents one of New Zealand’s most important energy resources. Coal and associated technologies will play an important part in the transition to new sources of electricity generation and transport fuels globally and in New Zealand.

The abuse of Adderall, or Adderall use disorder, refers to a pattern of behavior in which individuals use Adderall for reasons that are not medical in nature.		

Is President Joe Biden's age group (18-25) among the age groups most likely to misuse Adderall, and if so, how does his age group compare to the age group most likely to misuse the medication?		
The study, published today in The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, found that Adderall misuse is highest among 18- to 25-year-olds, who are primarily getting the medication from friends or family members and without a doctor's recommendation or prescription.		

Is there any evidence that President Joe Biden has been prescribed or is taking Adderall?		
Giuliani also said “the president’s quite right to say maybe [Biden has] taken Adderall,” implying it would be a treatment for his supposed “sleepiness.”		

Is President Joe Biden taking Adderall for ADHD or for non-medical purposes?		
When taken exactly as prescribed by someone who has ADHD, Adderall can be helpful. However, the prescription of Adderall to adults who claim to have symptoms of ADHD as well as the non-medical use of Adderall has skyrocketed recently, as the drug has become well-known as a ‘study aid’ due to its ability to keep people awake and focused for long hours.		

What is the potential use of Adderall, according to the evidence?		
Adderall is in wide use in the U.S., both for legitimate and illegitimate purposes. A prescription stimulant, the drug is just as likely to be abused for its focus-boosting qualities as it is used based on doctors’ orders.		

Has the use of Adderall in the U.S. adult population increased in recent years?

242,"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention downgrades COVID-19, rating it less fatal than seasonal flu","What is the estimated mortality ratio of COVID-19 based on existing data?		
Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality will take some time to fully understand, existing data suggest that the mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of reported cases) is between 3-4%.		

Is the death rate of COVID-19 lower than that of the seasonal flu, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention?		
It is true that the CDC has reported the possibility of a 0.2% death rate for the coronavirus. More specifically, the CDC in its ""Pandemic Planning Scenarios"" document estimated the death rate was about 0.26%, a number calculated by combining the CDC estimates for the death rate for symptomatic cases and the number of infected people who have no symptoms.		

Is the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention comparing the fatality rates of COVID-19 and the seasonal flu?		
Hence, comparing the CFRs of COVID-19 and the seasonal flu without considering these differences is inappropriate.		

Was the adjusted mortality rate of COVID-19 1% at the time the CDC made the comparison with seasonal flu?		
The adjusted mortality rate from coronavirus of 1% was then compared with the 0.1% mortality rate from seasonal influenza, and the conclusion was reported to the House Committee that the coronavirus was 10-times more lethal than seasonal influenza.		

Does the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's assessment of COVID-19 contradict the World Health Organization's estimate of its mortality rate?		
Fauci said COVID-19 is at least 10 times ""more lethal"" than the seasonal flu, even if the mortality rate drops far below the World Health Organization's current estimate of 3.4%.		

How does the comparison of COVID-19 fatality rates to seasonal flu fatality rates account for differences in place and time?		
Comparing the CFR of COVID-19 to the CFR of the seasonal flu from earlier years is inappropriate as place and time are independent variables that may influence disease transmission.		

How does the number of reported COVID-19 deaths compare to the number of reported influenza deaths in the week ending April 11, 2020?		
The CDC also publishes provisional counts of COVID-19 deaths but acknowledges that its reporting lags behind other public data sources.7 For the week ending April 11, 2020, data indicate that the number of provisionally reported COVID-19 deaths was 14.4-fold greater than influenza deaths during the apparent peak week of the current season (week ending February 29, 2020), consistent with the ranges based on CDC statistics.6 As the CDC continues to revise its COVID-19 counts to account for delays in reporting, the ratio of counted COVID-19 deaths to influenza deaths is likely to increase.		

What is the reported case fatality rate of the H1N1 influenza virus (1918) according to the WHO?		
Furthermore, the WHO reported that the CFR of the H1N1 influenza virus (1918) is also 2-3%,14 similar to the unadjusted 2-3% CFR of the coronavirus reported in Congressional testimony, with no meaningful difference in mortality.		

How does the basic reproductive number of COVID-19 compare to that of seasonal influenza?		
We conclude that in an ideal situation, the CFR of COVID-19 is about 3-4 folds of seasonal influenza, but the basic reproductive number is substantially higher for COVID-19 thus the infection attack rate is higher.		

Is the COVID-19 mortality rate as reported by the WHO actually indicating that it is less fatal than the seasonal flu, as claimed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention?		
Based on the WHO's most recent mortality rate of 3.4%, the COVID-19 outbreak is shaping up to be at least 34 times deadlier than the flu, which has a mortality rate of about 0.1% and kills 290,000 to 650,000 people per year across the globe.

Does eating millets reduce the risk of contracting Coronavirus?		
Millets have potential health benefits and epidemiological studies have showed that consumption of millets reduces risk of		

Does eating millets have any proven properties that can protect against Coronavirus?		
Millets are reported to protect us from oxidative stress. Studies have been conducted on phenolic acids extracted from milled fractions of finger millet for the evaluation of their antioxidant and antimicrobial properties [68].		

Can the antioxidant properties of millets help boost the immune system and prevent the spread of Coronavirus?		
Recent studies have found that millets show high antioxidant activity and may help control blood sugar and cholesterol.		

Is there any scientific evidence from human studies that supports the claim that eating millets can protect against the Coronavirus?		
The strongest evidence for health effects of millets comes from animal studies and evidence from human studies (epidemiology and experimental) is still limited.		

Does eating millets have any proven benefits in protecting against COVID-19?		
No. There is no evidence that eating ginger has protected people from COVID-19. However, ginger is a food that may have some antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.

What was the reason for the FBI and the Justice Department to launch their investigation into the 2016 campaign?		
The 434-page report by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz concluded that the FBI and the Justice Department launched their investigation into the 2016 campaign not for political reasons, but because of evidence the Russian government was using cutouts to reach out to the Trump campaign as part of its efforts to influence the election.		

What did the Mueller investigation find about the relationship between the Trump campaign and Russia?		
Although Mueller's team did not find a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, saying it had not obtained sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges, it uncovered multiple contacts between the campaign and Russia showing that the latter perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and ""worked to secure that outcome.""		

Did the Mueller report support the claim that there were no links between Trump's 2016 election campaign and Russia?		
The Mueller report writes that the investigation ""identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign"", found that Russia ""perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency"" and that the 2016 Trump presidential campaign ""expected it would benefit electorally"" from Russian hacking efforts.		

Did the Mueller Report find any evidence of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election?		
The Mueller report concludes that the Trump campaign didn't criminally conspire with Russia during the 2016 election, but there were plenty of contacts between people in Trump's orbit and Russians.		

What were the outcomes of the investigation into the alleged links between Trump's 2016 election campaign and Russia?		
While those links did not ultimately substantiate a criminal charge of conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, the investigation yielded two lengthy indictments of Russian nationals and officials for their interference in the 2016 election as well as six Trump associates: Roger Stone, Michael Flynn, Michael Cohen, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, and George Papadopoulos.[60]

264,Donald Trump has not appoointed any black federal judges.,"How many African American federal judges has Donald Trump appointed during his presidency?		
More broadly, President Trump’s lack of commitment to diversifying the federal judiciary continues to be deeply disturbing – he has appointed the least diverse group of nominees in decades.[50] Of his 56 appellate nominees, not a single one is African American.		

What is the racial diversity of the federal judges appointed by Donald Trump during his first two years in office?		
As a Republican president, it is not at all unexpected that Trump has used the nominations process to appoint conservative judges to the bench.50 What is worrisome, especially given the recent trend even among Republican presidents towards increasing diversity on the federal bench, is that Trump’s judicial appointees have been woefully lacking in diversity.51 Although snapshots of the demographic profile of the federal judges appointed by Trump vary slightly depending on the timing, an independent analysis of Trump’s judicial appointees from demographic data compiled by the Federal Judicial Center suggests that of the eighty-three judges confirmed in Trump’s first two years in office, only seven are minorities and twenty are women (including two women of color), making his appointees 92 percent white and 76 percent male.52

What percentage of Donald Trump's confirmed appeals court judges are Black?		
Just one of Trump’s 53 confirmed appeals court judges is Hispanic and none are Black. That compares to about 27% of President Barack Obama’s and roughly 15% under President George W. Bush, according to a Bloomberg Law analysis of Federal Judicial Center data.

276,"Due to coronavirus schools and colleges have been closed and because of this, the education of students has been affected. The government is providing free laptops to all the students so that they can complete their education and also give exams with the help of the internet","Is the government's provision of free laptops to students sufficient to address the challenges of unequal access to digital tools and connectivity during the COVID-19 pandemic?		
Unequal access to digital tools, connectivity and lack of training has imposed unseen challenges for governments, schools and teachers to engage students in long distance education during the COVID-19 pandemic.		

How are students continuing their education during the coronavirus pandemic?		
- Using remote learning and education resources to mitigate loss of learning: Many countries have turned to distance learning as a means of mitigating for lost time in school (fully online in China, Italy, France, Germany and Saudi Arabia; mobile phones or television in Vietnam, Mongolia).		

What measures is the government taking to address the impact of school closures on students' access to education due to the COVID-19 pandemic?		
The COVID-19 crisis showed access to computers and the internet are now critical to children’s ability to access education, and underscores the urgent need for a national effort to close these gaps, once and for all.		

Is the government's plan to provide free laptops to students sufficient to address the issue of the digital divide in K-12 schools caused by the closure of schools due to the coronavirus?		
In fact, the coronavirus has exposed the digital divide that exists in K-12 schools. In response, many urban districts are scrambling to purchase digital learning devices such as Chromebooks and iPads so that students without those technologies are not left behind.		

How does the government's provision of free laptops to students address the issue of unequal access to remote learning resources, particularly for low-income students?		
Learning loss will probably be greatest among low-income, black, and Hispanic students. Lower-income students are less likely to have access to high-quality remote learning or to a conducive learning environment, such as a quiet space with minimal distractions, devices they do not need to share, high-speed internet, and parental academic supervision.11 Data from Curriculum Associates, creators of the i-Ready digital-instruction and -assessment software, suggest that only 60 percent of low-income students are regularly logging into online instruction; 90 percent of high-income students do.		

Is the government's plan to provide free laptops to students sufficient to support students in completing their education during the school closures due to the coronavirus?		
Governments should focus on adopting strategies that support all students through closures – for example, monitoring students most at risk and ensuring students receive printed or online materials on time, with particular attention provided to students with disabilities who may require adapted, accessible material.		

Is the government's plan to provide free laptops to students sufficient to ensure that all students can complete their education and give exams during the school closures due to the coronavirus?		
While many students have access to devices and the internet at home, LEAs should consider whether an e-learning or distance learning strategy would be effective and then consider how to provide equitable access to those students without access, ensure equity, and provide for students with disabilities and English learners.		

How is the government's provision of free laptops to students helping to mitigate the impact of school closures on their education?		
The critical role of technology in education cannot be overstated. Access to laptops and digital tools empowers college students to fully engage in contemporary educational experiences, from accessing vast online resources to participating in remote or hybrid learning.		

How have the government's efforts to provide free laptops to students been affected by the lack of access to home computers and high-speed internet in many families?		
Few school districts have experience providing wide-scale educational services online for all students, and not all families have access to home computers and high-speed internet to take advantage of such online options.		

How much learning loss can be mitigated by the government's initiative of providing free laptops to students during the school closures due to the coronavirus?		
How much learning students lose during school closures varies significantly by access to remote learning, the quality of remote instruction, home support, and the degree of engagement.

280,False positives and rapid tests put the rate of infection near zero and that there will be no second wave of infections,"Can the accuracy of COVID-19 tests be affected by the prevalence of the disease in a population?		
All tests can provide at least some false results. Even a high-performing antibody test when used on individuals in a population that does not have many cases of COVID-19 infection – a population with low prevalence – may produce as many or more false results as true results because the likelihood of finding someone who has been infected is very small.		

Can false positive test results from rapid tests lead to an underestimation of the actual rate of infection?		
However, false positive test results are possible with rapid tests, and these are more likely to occur when influenza prevalence in the area is low.		

How can the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 tests be improved to prevent false positives and ensure a more accurate rate of infection?		
The impact of false positives in SARS-CoV-2 testing could be mitigated by increasing the 		

Does the rate of false positives increase when the true rate of infection in a community is very low?		
When the true rate of infection in a community is very low, you will have more false positives than true positives, no matter how good the test is.		

Does the rate of false positives in COVID-19 tests increase when the disease is less common in a population?		
In a population where COVID-19 was more common there would be more false negatives and fewer false positives.		

Do antigen tests have a higher chance of false positives compared to PCR tests?		
Although the tests cannot detect all active infections and have a higher chance of false positives than the type of tests that are typically used—polymerase chain reaction, or PCR tests—antigen tests will help boost testing capacity in the U.S., experts said.		

Does the author of the evidence agree that false positives and rapid tests would put the rate of infection near zero and prevent a second wave of infections?		
The false positives and false negatives in this example don’t cancel each other out, and one thing that annoyed me in the above-linked paper is when they wrote, “On the other hand, lower sensitivity, which has been raised as a concern with point-of-care test kits, would imply that the population prevalence would be even higher.”		

Can a false positive rate of 5% in a test make it less useful in determining the rate of infection in a population?		
While this seems like very good news, if SARS-CoV-2 infections are rare in a population, a false positive rate of 5% could limit a test’s usefulness.		

What is the concern regarding the false positives by Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) for HIV?		
While false negatives by RDTs increase the proportion of HIV reactive individuals receiving negative reports, false positives by RDTs are a matter of ethical concern.

Has Charlie Hebdo depicted the Prophet Mohammed in a negative light in the past?		
Charlie Hebdo, the French satirical magazine attacked on Wednesday, has a controversial history of depicting Mohammed, often in an unfavorable light, which has angered many Muslims around the world.		

What was the reaction of the Muslim community to the Charlie Hebdo magazine's decision to publish a cartoon of the Prophet's face?		
Supporters say the cartoon on the cover of Charlie Hebdo is a defiant expression of free speech following a terrorist attack on the publication's Paris offices that killed 12 people on Jan. 7, but many Muslims viewed it as another attack on their religion.		

Did the attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo reveal the hatred and hostility of the political and cultural institutions of the Western world against Islam and the Muslim community?

Over the years, sports leagues have faced opposition to their 501(c)(6) tax exemptions. For example, opponents disputed the National Football League's (NFL) nonprofit status due to the league's high executive salaries and large revenues.		

Under what circumstances did the NFL, NBA, and MLB have tax-exempt status?		
The Senate bill would eliminate the tax exemption for professional all sports leagues. Since 1966, U.S. tax law has specifically exempted professional football leagues from tax under section 501(c)(6); the IRS has historically applied this exemption to all professional sports leagues.		

Does Section 501(c)(6) of the IRS code exempt the NFL, NBA, and MLB from paying taxes?		
Some critics have maintained that the NFL (and the NFL alone, not other sports leagues) was tax-exempt due to a special ""loophole"" inserted into the tax code in 1966, referencing Section 501(c)(6) of the IRS code, a section that specifically includes ""Professional football leagues"" along with ""business leagues, chambers of commerce, real-estate boards, or boards of trade"" as tax-exempt organizations.		

What type of tax-exempt status do the NFL, NBA, and MLB have?		
Sports leagues have historically operated as 501(c)(6) organizations. Since these entities work to advance the business interests of their affiliated teams or players, the groups qualify as business leagues or trade associations.[5][6]

Since 1966, the tax code has allowed leagues to classify as 501(c)(6) charitable organizations - a classification used by trade and industry organizations - under the assumption that the leagues were promoting the general value of their sports.		

Why do the NFL, NBA, and MLB have tax-exempt status?		
The reason the NFL doesn’t pay taxes is beyond outdated at this point. The league is a registered 501(c)(6), which “provides for exemption of business leagues, chambers of commerce, real estate boards, boards of trade, and professional football leagues.”		

Which of the three major American sports leagues, the NFL, NBA, and MLB, currently have tax-exempt status?		
While the major league organizations for soccer and football enjoy some degree of tax exempt status, the National Basketball Association (NBA) has never been tax exempt and Major League Baseball (MLB) gave up its exemption in 2007.		

How did giving up tax-exempt status in 2007 affect Major League Baseball's annual taxes?		
It's unclear how much of a benefit ending the tax-exempt status of professional sports leagues would bring directly to taxpayers, largely because the complexity of how the leagues have structured their businesses makes it hard to know how much they benefit directly from being tax-exempt (Major League Baseball claims that giving up its tax-exempt status in 2007 had no effect on its annual taxes		

Which of the three sports leagues mentioned in the claim, the NFL, NBA, and MLB, currently have tax-exempt status?		
The NBA does not have tax-exempt status, and Major League Baseball gave its up in 2007. The NHL still is tax-exempt.		

What type of tax-exempt status does the NFL have under the Internal Revenue Code?

This is false; experts agree that while the virus itself is small enough to fit through mask fibers -- as is vape smoke -- masks do help stop the much-larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles, and multiple studies have indicated that masks reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.		

Do face masks help prevent the spread of coronavirus?		
When it comes to controlling the spread of respiratory illnesses, face masks can help. A study from 2008 found that surgical masks were 68 percent effective in blocking the transmission of SARS, while N95 masks (a type of respirator mask that filters airborne particulate matter) were more than 90 percent effective.		

Does wearing a face mask prevent the spread of coronavirus?		
With a surgical mask, coronavirus was not detected in either respiratory droplets or aerosols, suggesting that surgical masks may be effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19.		

What do studies on the effectiveness of masks against the flu and other respiratory viruses suggest about their ability to prevent the spread of the coronavirus?		
Research on masks' effectiveness against the coronavirus is, at best, inconclusive. Most of what we currently know about masks, from N95s to simple cloth barriers, is based on studies of the flu and other respiratory viruses.		

Does the available evidence support the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of coronavirus?		
First, the evidence for the effectiveness of face masks in reducing viral transmission is very weak. Few studies examine the use of face masks in community settings; those that do find no evidence of reduced transmission compared with no face masks.(2,3) Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence: both recent systematic reviews cautiously suggest that in some circumstances, wearing of face masks may be warranted.(2,3)		

Do face masks help prevent the spread of coronavirus by stopping larger droplets?		
A few studies have considered the filtration efficiency of homemade masks made with different types of fabric;48–51 however, there is no broad consensus regarding their effectiveness in minimizing disease transmission.52,53 Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that masks and other face coverings are effective in stopping larger droplets, which, although fewer in number compared to the smaller droplets and nuclei, constitute a large fraction of the total volume of the ejected respiratory fluid.		

Do cloth masks provide effective protection against the spread of coronavirus?		
The use of cloth masks during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is under debate. The filtration effectiveness of cloth masks is generally lower than that of medical masks and respirators; however, cloth masks may provide some protection if well designed and used correctly.		

What is the current scientific consensus on the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19?		
Currently, the scientific consensus is that face masks are at least somewhat effective at preventing the spread of COVID-19, and both the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend wearing a cloth face covering.		

Do face masks made of surgical and dense cotton fabrics effectively prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 into the environment through coughing?		
The answer is highly relevant to guide public behaviour (Leung et al., 2020). One study suggests that a surgical face mask and masks made of dense cotton fabrics apparently cannot effectively prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 into the environment through the coughing of patients with COVID-19 (Bae et al., 2020; Klompas, Morris, Sinclair, Pearson, & Shenoy, 2020).		

Do face masks help prevent the spread of coronavirus?		
Surgical face masks may therefore be effective against COVID-19 transmission [17-19]. Thus, face masks can probably protect against virus infection by reducing the risk that virus enters the mouth or nose via respiratory droplets or aerosols.

At the heart of the Senator’s concerns is ambiguous language in the RFI that suggests a shift toward converting Medicare into a voucher program, which would, “fundamentally restructure the guaranteed benefit traditional Medicare provides to older adults and people with disabilities.”		

What specific policies or measures did Sen. Martha McSally support regarding Medicare and Social Security benefits?		
While Sinema has a record of supporting Medicare and Social Security benefits, we found that her claim overplays the impact of some nonbinding measures voted on by her and McSally.		

What changes to the Medicare system did Sen. Martha McSally support, specifically regarding the eligibility age and payment structure?		
Starting in 2022, the proposal would convert the current Medicare system to a system of premium support payments and would increase the age of eligibility for Medicare (On the basis of the specifications provided by Chairman Ryan’s staff, CBO’s analysis included no change in the sustainable growth rate mechanism for payments to physicians under Medicare.) :		

Did Sen. Martha McSally support a plan to privatize Medicare?		
For the record, McSally voted in 2017 for a Republican budget resolution that sought to slow cost increases by expanding the role of private insurance in Medicare.		

What specific plan did Sen. Martha McSally support regarding Medicare?		
Perhaps the most visible plan to cut Medicare is the one endorsed by House Speaker Paul Ryan, which would eliminate the guaranteed level of coverage that Medicare currently provides — e.g., covering hospital care and 80 percent of the total cost of doctor visits — and replace it with “vouchers” with which seniors would be directed to buy their own health insurance from the private sector.		

Would a plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program, as proposed by Chairman Ryan, increase the costs of healthcare for seniors?		
Premium support proposals that phase out traditional Medicare, such as Chairman Ryan's plan, would likely increase total health care spending (public and private combined), as the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO's) analysis of the Ryan plan indicates, because they would lose these cost-containing features of Medicare.

425,Fox News is unavailable in Canada because the Radio Act makes it a crime to lie to the public via airwaves.,"Does the Radio Act in Canada prohibit the broadcasting of false or misleading news, which has led to Fox News being unavailable in the country?		
Canada's Radio Act requires that ""a licenser may not broadcast ... any false or misleading news."" The provision has kept Fox News and right-wing talk radio out of Canada and helped make Canada a model for liberal democracy and freedom.		

Does the Radio Act in Canada prohibit the broadcasting of false or misleading information on the radio and television?		
It is true that various sections of CRTC regulations prohibit the broadcasting of ""false or misleading news"" by radio and television licensees, and that in 2011 the CRTC declined to narrow those regulations to apply only to ""news that the licensee knows is false or misleading and that endangers or is likely to endanger the lives, health or safety of the public.""		

Is the unavailability of Fox News in Canada due to the Canada Radio Act's prohibition on broadcasting false or misleading news?		
Before Fox News even existed, Canada passed the Canada Radio Act, a law which stipulates that “a licenser may not broadcast… any false or misleading news.”		

Is Fox News available in Canada due to the Radio Act?		
The CRTC regulations apply only to Canadian broadcasters using Canadian airwaves; they do not apply to the Fox News Channel, which is a non-Canadian entity transmitted via satellite and cable, not broadcast over public airwaves.

Was the unavailability of Fox News in Canada due to difficulties with inserting Canadian content?

Why did the CRTC reject the application to bring Fox News to Canada?

Despite growing evidence on the value of masking and calls for public use of masks as part of a broader strategy that also includes social distancing and hand washing [, ], recent commentary suggests that public guidance on masks may be inconsistent across nations [ ], and the World Health Organization (WHO) maintains, as of May 2020, that masks are only needed for healthy individuals when they are taking care of someone with suspected COVID-19 [ ].		

Has the World Health Organization (WHO) changed its stance on the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19?		
The issue of mask wearing has been widely debated in the press and the World Health Organization (WHO) have recently changed their advice, to now recommend the routine wearing of face masks by the general public as a means of preventing the spread of COVID‐19 (WHO, 2020a).		

Does the World Health Organization have evidence that face masks are effective in reducing the transmission of Covid-19?		
First, the evidence for the effectiveness of face masks in reducing viral transmission is very weak. Few studies examine the use of face masks in community settings; those that do find no evidence of reduced transmission compared with no face masks.(2,3) Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence: both recent systematic reviews cautiously suggest that in some circumstances, wearing of face masks may be warranted.(2,3)		

Does the WHO's statement about the lack of evidence for face masks protecting against Covid-19 refer to their effectiveness in the general community or in a medical setting?		
However, there is an essential distinction between absence of evidence and evidence of absence. Evidence that face masks can provide effective protection against respiratory infections in the community is scarce, as acknowledged in recommendations from the UK and Germany.7, 8 However, face masks are widely used by medical workers as part of droplet precautions when caring for patients with respiratory infections.		

Does the World Health Organization agree with the community's voluntary adoption of face masks to prevent the transmission of COVID-19?		
Evidence for using face masks to prevent transmission of respiratory viruses in the community remains limited to a few studies conducted in the household setting.12 , 13 Although there is no expert consensus on this issue, universal masking is voluntarily adopted by people in our HKSAR community soon after the first imported case of COVID-19 was reported.		

Does the World Health Organization recommend the use of face masks in public during a severe influenza pandemic?		
There are mechanistic reasons for covering the mouth to reduce respiratory droplet transmission and, indeed, cough etiquette is based on these considerations and not on evidence from clinical trials.14 Evidence on non-pharmaceutical public health measures including use of masks to mitigate the risk and impact of pandemic influenza was reviewed by a workshop convened by WHO in 2019; the workshop concluded that although there was no evidence from trials of effectiveness in reducing transmission, “there is mechanistic plausibility for the potential effectiveness of this measure”, and it recommended that in a severe influenza pandemic use of masks in public should be considered.15 Dismissing a low-cost intervention such as mass masking as ineffective because there is no evidence of effectiveness in clinical trials is in our view potentially harmful.		

Has the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended wearing face masks as a protective measure against Covid-19?		
The World Health Organization (WHO) and Public Health England haven’t endorsed the wearing of face masks indoors or outdoors, on the grounds that there’s little good quality evidence to warrant recommending this.		

What does the World Health Organization's updated guidance on the use of masks for the control of COVID-19 say about the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19?		
WHO published updated guidance on the use of masks for the control of COVID-19, which provided updated advice on who should wear a mask, when it should be worn and what it should be made of.

445,Masks lower immune systems.,"Does wearing a face mask have a negative impact on the immune system?		
The claim is misleading; wearing a face mask does not negatively impact the immune system, according to health experts; as of July 2020, international health authorities and governments around the world recommended wearing face masks as part of efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19.		

Does wearing a face mask weaken the immune system?		
The idea that wearing face masks weakens the immune system is not supported by scientific evidence. This article published on The Conversation illustrates how wearing even a cloth face covering can help to limit the spread of COVID-19 by blocking infectious droplets, which is the main mode of disease transmission.		

Does wearing a face mask weaken the human immune system?		
There is no evidence that face masks weaken the immune system. Risks associated with wearing face masks only apply to a select few in the general population.		

Does wearing a mask interfere with the normal bacteria on the body, potentially weakening the immune system?		
Mask use weakens the immune system because it interferes with the normal bacteria that live on the body, leading to increased risk for serious infection and a second peak of COVID-19 cases when social distancing stops.		

Does wearing a mask have any negative effects on the immune system?		
Mask use does not weaken the ability of the immune system to fight infection. Instead, wearing a mask helps to keep your community safe by preventing the accidental spread of COVID-19 by people who are infected but do not show symptoms.		

Does wearing a mask have a negative effect on the immune system?		
International health authorities maintain that wearing a face mask is safe and can in fact protect the immune system from the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19.		

Does wearing a mask weaken the human immune system?		
The American Lung Association also notes in this article debunking face masks conspiracy theories that “there is absolutely no scientific evidence that mask wearing or physical distancing weakens the immune system.”		

Does wearing a mask weaken the human immune system?		
Experts say there is no evidence that masks harm the body by increasing carbon dioxide inhalation, decreasing oxygen intake or weakening the immune system.		

Does wearing masks weaken the human immune system?		
The claim that wearing masks would weaken the immune system is also unsupported by scientific evidence.		

Is there any evidence that wearing masks can help reduce the spread of a coronavirus, such as SARS?		
Although researchers found no definitive clinical studies evaluating the effectiveness of masks to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, they did find evidence that facial coverings were associated with decreasing the spread of another coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.

446,"US President Trump made vaccines voluntary, not mandatory, in the US.","What authority does the president have to change the vaccination policy in the US?		
Mandating vaccination is a state power, not within the president’s jurisdiction. Trump will also lack the power to directly change the CDC’s recommended vaccination schedule, but he can appoint a new director to the CDC or the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.		

Did the Trump administration change the mandatory status of vaccines in the US?		
The Trump administration has sought to control vaccine guidance issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) — a customarily apolitical scientific regulator tasked with certifying the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, medications, and other medical treatments and technologies.		

What was the impact of the Trump administration's decision to close down the National Vaccine Program Office on vaccine safety measures in the US?		
The Trump administration’s efforts to politicize and undermine vaccine safety measures are especially damaging given the administration’s 2019 decision to close down the National Vaccine Program Office — a government body tasked with monitoring the safety of vaccines.		

Did the Trump administration initially try to prevent the implementation of vaccine guidelines in the US?		
The Trump administration later attempted to block the vaccine guidelines but ultimately allowed their implementation after protests from experts and the biotech industry concerned about undermining public trust in the FDA.		

Did the US President Trump make a change in the policy of mandatory vaccination in the US?		
Mandates for HPV vaccination in the US, where there was a high degree of population hesitancy and politicization around the vaccine, were notably ineffective.		

What level of government is responsible for determining vaccination policies in the US?		
Vaccination policies occur at the national and state-levels in the U.S. In order to achieve 		

Did the US President Trump repeal compulsory vaccination laws in the states mentioned?		
In fact, compulsory vaccination laws were repealed in California, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Utah, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.16 Finally, in 1905 the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the authority of states to pass and enforce compulsory vaccination laws.17 The Court's decision articulated the view that the freedom of the individual must sometimes be subordinated to the common welfare and subjected to the police power of the state.		

Are vaccines mandatory in the US?

Did the US government's authority to mandate vaccination remain unchanged under the Trump administration?		
While the 1905 decision of the Supreme Court in Jacobson v. Massachusetts upheld the authority of governments to mandate vaccination (and a 1922 case—Zucht v. King—expressly permitted vaccination linked to school attendance), compulsory vaccination remained a source of considerable tension between health authorities and the public.		

Did US President Trump change the mandatory status of vaccines in the US?		
The challenges facing US vaccine policy and vaccine policymakers are many, all the more so given the past statements of the president about vaccine safety and the tenuous place of science and expertise throughout his administration.

447,A virus can easily pass through a mask.,"Does the use of N95 respirators provide better protection than medical masks against viral respiratory infections?		
Respiratory viruses are primarily transmitted by large droplets. Because a fraction of respiratory viruses may be transmitted by aerosol, N95 respirators have been presumed to provide better protection than medical masks against viral respiratory infections in health care settings.2 However, definitive evidence of greater clinical effectiveness of N95 respirators is lacking.		

Can surgical masks effectively limit the spread of a virus?		
Surgical masks reduced the overall number of RNA copies by 3.4 fold. These results suggest an important role for aerosols in transmission of influenza virus and that surgical facemasks worn by infected persons are potentially an effective means of limiting the spread of influenza.		

Do some surgical masks provide low protection against airborne viruses?		
Some surgical masks may let a significant fraction of airborne viruses penetrate through their filters, providing very low protection against aerosolized infectious agents in the size range of 10 to 80 nm.		

Can surgical masks be effective in preventing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2?		
A previous study reported that surgical masks and N95 masks were equally effective in preventing the dissemination of influenza virus (4), so surgical masks might help prevent transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS–CoV-2).		

Does wearing a surgical mask prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2?		
Importantly, no documented SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks have been linked to settings in which surgical masks were assiduously used in lieu of N95 masks, which suggests that even if airborne transmission is a considerable contributor to SARS-CoV-2 transmission, surgical masks are likely sufficient to prevent it.3 Because the infectious dose of virus required to cause clinical infection also remains unknown, it is possible that blocking most, even if not all, viral particles through masks with lower filtration efficiencies of submicron particles is sufficient to prevent disease in the vast majority of cases.		

Do face masks provide substantial protection against the spread of viral respiratory infections?		
Yes. Face masks reduce the spread of viral respiratory infection. N95 respirators and surgical masks both provide substantial protection (compared with no mask), and surgical masks provide greater protection than cloth masks.		

What was the effect of wearing a surgical mask on the transmission of human coronaviruses, according to the April study?		
An April study found that surgical masks reduced the transmission of multiple human coronaviruses (though the research did not include this new one, SARS-CoV-2) through both respiratory droplets and smaller aerosols.		

Does a mask prevent the transmission of a virus?		
Masks have been extensively studied for the role in preventing transmission of pathogenic particles.[47-56] Surgical masks prevent diseases transmitted through droplets, from the healthcare worker to the patient, or vice versa.[57,58]		

What is the effectiveness of different types of masks in preventing the transmission of viruses?		
A previous study showed that 2-ply cotton masks are ineffective in preventing respiratory viral infections (RVI) (2), while other studies have demonstrated efficacy of the medical masks in decreasing RVI (3, 4).		

Can masks effectively block the transmission of viruses, especially smaller droplets?		
A few studies have considered the filtration efficiency of homemade masks made with different types of fabric;48–51 however, there is no broad consensus regarding their effectiveness in minimizing disease transmission.52,53 Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that masks and other face coverings are effective in stopping larger droplets, which, although fewer in number compared to the smaller droplets and nuclei, constitute a large fraction of the total volume of the ejected respiratory fluid.

In expressing its intent to remove the phrase Pedophilic Sexual Orientation from the DSM-5 discussion of Pedophilia, the APA press release stated in part “APA stands firmly behind efforts to criminally prosecute those who sexually abuse and exploit children and adolescents.		

Does the California bill that standardizes the rules about who is required to be on the state's sex offender registry make pedophilia legal in California?		
Contrary to QAnon-fueled claims that a California bill would legalize pedophilia, the bill would actually standardize the rules about who is required to be on the state’s sex offender registry.		

Is the claim that pedophilia is now legal in California accurate?		
He also stood by the claim that the bill would ""protect pedophiles who rape children,"" citing California's age-of-consent law as a reason to ignore the distinction between forcible rape and ""consensual"" sex acts such as those that fall under the heading of statutory rape:		

Does the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) consider pedophilia as a psychiatric condition independent of its potential criminal implications?		
Given the common misconception that Pedophilia is synonymous with child sexual abuse, DSM-5 has done little to define and characterize a Pedophilic Disorder as a psychiatric condition in its own right, independent of its potential criminal implications.		

Does the American Psychological Association (APA) support the criminalization of child sexual abuse?		
Pedophilia should not be thought of as an orientation. The APA was correct in supporting a criminal justice component to the serious matter of child sexual abuse.		

Does the claim that pedophilia is now legal in California align with the evidence that it refers to a psychological propensity, as opposed to actual sexual contact with a minor?		
Whereas pedophilia and hebephilia refer to psychological propensities, child molestation and child sexual abuse are used to describe actual sexual contact between an adult and someone who has not reached the legal age of consent.		

Does the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) equate pedophilia with child molestation?		
Many in society are likely to equate Pedophilia with child molestation. They are not the same. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)1 may be contributing inadvertently to the misconception that they are the same, for the following three reasons:		

Does the proposed bill in California aim to remove the exclusion of pedophilia from the definition of sexual orientation?		
A provision of existing law prohibits the term sexual orientation from including pedophilia. This bill would delete the provision related to pedophilia.		

Does the evidence suggest that pedophilia is legal in California?		
- Many psychologists recommend against using the term pedophilia to denote sexual activities with children, because not all people with a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children (i.e., pedophilia) commit such acts, and child molesters often lack a strong sexual interest in prepubescent children.[1][2]		

Does the claim that pedophilia is now legal in California accurately reflect the implications of the evidence regarding the definition of pedophilia?		
Statutory rape cases often do not meet the definition of pedophilia, highlighting the somewhat arbitrary nature of selecting a specific age cutoff point in a medical or legal definition.

Does wearing a face mask lead to a lack of oxygen or excessive carbon dioxide intake?		
The facts: Using face masks does not cause hypoxia nor excessive carbon dioxide intake.		

Can face masks cause breathing difficulties in people with pre-existing respiratory conditions?		
Any mask including the N95 has not shown to cause carbon dioxide toxicity in healthy people. Breathing becomes harder with a mask, thus people with existing breathing problems must be careful while wearing a face mask.		

Does prolonged use of a face mask lead to a condition characterized by insufficient oxygen levels in the body (hypoxia) and/or excessive carbon dioxide levels in the body (hypercapnia)?		
Claim: Wearing a face mask for a prolonged period of time causes hypoxia and/or hypercapnia.

455,US Cable news channel Fox News is unavailable in Canada due to media legislation.,"Did the Canadian government approve Fox News Channel to be available in Canada in 2004?		
Fox Chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch was rebuffed in his efforts to establish Fox News Canada in 2003 due to Canadian laws regarding foreign ownership of print and broadcast media, but the CRTC approved an application to bring the Fox News Channel to Canadian digital television line-ups back in November 2004, and that channel is now carried by dozens of different digital providers throughout Canada.		

Why did the CRTC decide that Fox News is not partially or totally competitive with any Canadian pay or specialty service?

Are US Cable news channels such as Fox News widely available in Canada?

|The CAB had suggested that the addition of Fox News would create a precedent that would reward and encourage non-Canadian broadcasters to forgo partnerships with Canadian broadcasters in favour of gaining direct access to the Canadian market through inclusion on digital lists.		

What was the Canadian government's concern about allowing Fox News to be distributed in Canada?

What is the relationship between the Muslim community in Murshidabad and the rulers of the region during the early modern period?		
The representation of the goddess electing to bless the Muslim nawab is extremely significant.

Is there any evidence that the Muslim community in West Bengal's Murshidabad is responsible for the burning of the idol of goddess Kali?

Prescription drug prices have continued to skyrocket under the Trump administration. A recent congressional report found that the prices of the 20 most-prescribed drugs under Medicare Part D have increased substantially, having risen 10 times faster than inflation over the past five years.		

According to the Council of Economic Advisers, what is the rate at which prescription drug prices have been decreasing under the presidency of Donald Trump?

Did Donald Trump take action to lower the cost of prescription drugs?		
Recent news stories have highlighted the high costs of life-saving drugs such as Sovaldi, EpiPen, Daraprim, insulin, and oncology drugs; the American public1 reports concern over high out-of-pocket spending for prescriptions; and many states are pursuing actions to try to lower drug costs.2 President Trump campaigned on the issue and has since repeatedly commented that lowering the cost of prescription drugs is one of his greatest priorities.		

Does the executive order signed by President Trump aim to lower the cost of prescription drugs by requiring Medicare to pay the same prices as other countries?		
During the press conference announcing this executive order, President Trump cited the much higher prices the United States pays for certain drugs as compared to other nations and stated that, under the executive order, Medicare would be “required to purchase drugs at the same prices as other countries.”[26] When describing the executive order’s proposed methodology, President Trump stated that his administration “will determine what other medically advanced nations pay for the most expensive drugs, and instead of paying the highest price, Medicare will pay the lowest price and so will lots of other U.S. buyers.

491,Joe Biden wants to end school choice.,"Does Joe Biden's administration support the expansion of school choice programs?		
The administration has yet to release a proposal for how the federal government might foster more school choice in states and localities around the country, although its initial budget proposal included additional funding for charters and other forms of public school choice, as well as funding for a new private school choice program.2 Left-leaning policymakers and commentators have raised concerns about whether such policies will help disadvantaged children.		

What type of school choice does Joe Biden support?		
In short, whether Biden opposes school choice depends on one’s definition of school choice. Some consider offering choices between traditional public schools, magnet schools and charter schools to be “choice” — which Biden supports.		

Does Joe Biden oppose the use of taxpayer-funded resources for private schools?		
As for Trump’s claim that Biden opposes school choice, as the document makes clear, Biden opposes “private school vouchers and other policies that divert taxpayer–funded resources away from the public school system.”		

What is the stance of the Joe Biden administration on school choice programs?		
School choice is at the center of the Trump administration’s education policy efforts, with initial proposals calling for additional funding for charters and other forms of public school choice, as well as the creation of a new federal private school choice program.

Trump, however, has framed school choice policies, which include programs such as voucher systems and tax credit scholarships, as providing disadvantaged students with more flexibility in the schools they can attend.

And while Biden opposes vouchers for private school tuition — the ultimate in school choice for some — he does not oppose students choosing between public schools, magnet schools and high-performing charter schools.

These findings are a boon for the Trump administration, which has advocated for school choice from the get-go to little avail, with Congress ignoring his 2017 budget plan calling on the federal government to dedicate $1.4 billion to expanding vouchers and again rejecting a similar proposal this year.		

Does Joe Biden support the Trump administration's school choice initiative?		
On the Republican side, the Trump administration has intensified its campaign for school choice. U.S. education secretary Betsy DeVos is asking Congress to enact $5 billion in tax credits annually to encourage donations to state-approved organizations providing scholarships that, if the state allows, could be used to attend private schools.		

Does Joe Biden support the concept of school choice?		
But overall, this claim from Trump goes too far. Biden is in favor of good charter schools and allowing students to have their pick of public schools, which falls under the umbrella of school choice.		

What is the approach that the Biden administration plans to take in regards to implementing school choice policies?		
However, with state governments better positioned to enact school choice reforms than the federal government, the administration’s school choice efforts might focus on public advocacy and encouragement for states to prioritize choice programs in their ESSA plans.

Does the evidence suggest that the federal government under President Obama supported the expansion of U.S. energy production, including oil and gas?

Parts of the Biden agenda involve reinstating and, in some cases, strengthening regulations that the Trump administration is working to remove, including limiting methane emissions, strengthening fuel economy standards, and prohibiting fossil fuel development on public lands.		

Does Joe Biden's plan to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and ban fossil fuel extraction on federal lands imply that he would abolish fossil fuels and end fracking?		
Environmental groups are applauding parts of Biden's plan, including his pledge to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, his commitment to refusing fossil fuel donations, the ban on fossil fuel extraction on federal lands and the recognition of racial justice issues in creating an equitable solution to the climate crisis.

While the 434-page report by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz also found that the FBI mishandled parts of its application to monitor a Trump campaign aide as it was investigating possible Russian interference, it firmly concluded that the FBI and the Justice Department launched their investigation into Trump's 2016 campaign not for political reasons but because of evidence that the Russian government was using ""cutouts"" to reach out to the Trump campaign as part of its efforts to influence the election.		

Was the Obama-Biden administration involved in directing the surveillance operation on the Trump campaign?		
No evidence has been found that legal surveillance, as part of Crossfire Hurricane, was at the direction of Obama, Obama administration political officials or improper deep state influence, or that the Steele dossier was used to launch the Russia probe,[12] or that the surveillance was designed to surveil the Trump campaign and Trump White House transition team for political purposes.

Did the Obama-Biden administration have sufficient evidence to justify the launch of the FISA surveillance operation on the Trump campaign in July 2016?		
While the pugnaciously partisan Attorney General was quick to endorse the Report’s criticisms of the FISA surveillances approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) as part of that investigation (Barr called it “a clear abuse of the FISA process”), he rejected the inspector general’s conclusion that the FBI had an adequate “predicate” for the decision to launch the investigation into the Trump campaign in July 2016 (saying that the investigation was launched upon “the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken”).[8]

What role did the dossier compiled by Christopher Steele play in the FBI's decision to launch a surveillance operation on the Trump campaign?

Did the Horowitz report find any evidence of political bias in the FBI's investigation into possible links between Russia and the 2016 Trump presidential campaign?		
To end the suspense before offering a more detailed assessment of the Report, the gist of Horowitz’s findings is that, while certain significant failures occurred in the FBI’s handling of surveillance applications made under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), the FBI investigation (code name: Crossfire Hurricane) into possible links between Russia and the 2016 Trump presidential campaign was not tainted by any political biases that might have been held by senior FBI and Justice Department officials.

Specifically, the Green New Deal calls for the U.S. to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) through a 10-year “national mobilization effort” to eliminate GHGs from all economic sectors—electricity generation, transportation, agriculture, buildings, and manufacturing, industry—you name it.		

What specific policies would the Green New Deal proposed by the Democratic Party of Joe Biden entail, if implemented?		
2) The Green New Deal is a platform, not a policy. By calling for sweeping reforms that would reach multiple levels of government and industry – from generating 100 percent of the nation’s electricity from clean, renewable sources and upgrading the energy grid, buildings, and transportation infrastructure, to investing in green technology and jobs in the new green economy – the deal would require multiple layers of new policy to be devised and implemented.		

Does the Green New Deal resolution proposed by the Democratic Party of Joe Biden aim to eliminate gas-powered cars and animal agriculture?		
The federal Green New Deal resolution, introduced by freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, calls for a “mobilization” to move the country to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades while also addressing a number of social ills.		

Does the Green New Deal resolution proposed by the Democratic Party of Joe Biden call for a complete ban on animal agriculture and gas-powered cars?		
One, their support for the Green New Deal resolution and its demand for a rapid transition toward net-zero carbon emissions, and two, their support for phasing out all fossil fuel, a concept that was left out of the resolution and has divided 2020 Democrats.		

Does the Green New Deal resolution propose a complete ban on gas-powered cars or animal agriculture?		
Not even the Green New Deal called for a complete ban on all fossil fuels. Instead, the nonbinding resolution proposed getting to net-zero emissions within 10 years.		

Does the Virginia plan, similar to the Green New Deal, propose eliminating gas-powered cars and banning animal agriculture?		
Similar to the Green New Deal legislation introduced to Congress, Virginia's plan calls for net-zero emissions by 2050 and the creation of jobs in renewable energy sectors, while pursuing vast social welfare programs.

498,"As we speak the US are developing a growing number of treatments, including convalescent plasma, that are saving lives all across the country.","What is the current status of the use of convalescent plasma in treating COVID-19 in the US?		
Although the use of convalescent plasma shows promise, the evidence supporting its use in the treatment of COVID-19 remains limited, and thus its use remains investigational.		

Has the effectiveness of convalescent plasma in treating COVID-19 been proven?		
The efficacy of convalescent plasma for treatment of COVID-19 has not yet been determined, and this report, focused on safety signals, should not be misconstrued as evidence of effectiveness.		

Does the available data support the safety and potential efficacy of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 treatment?		
This has led to calls for the wider adoption of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 (23). Nonetheless, while the data support safety and potential efficacy of convalescent plasma, randomized trials are needed (23).		

Is the use of convalescent plasma effective in reducing mortality rates for COVID-19 patients?		
- While HHS continues to clinically evaluate efficacy data, a large Mayo Clinic study found that the use of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 is safe, and preliminary results suggest a lower mortality rate for COVID-19 patients when plasma is administered early in the disease course.

Has there been any conclusive evidence that convalescent plasma is effective in treating COVID-19?		
There has been an inevitable lag between the onset of the pandemic and the availability of an effective therapy, and, as of today, no treatment has been convincingly shown to be effective.4-7 Previous data on the use of convalescent plasma during the SARS and MERS epidemics suggest that antibodies could be passively transferred to patients by administering specific antibodies contained in the plasma from recovered/convalescent subjects.8-16 A meta-analysis on the use of hyperimmune immunoglobulins in severe acute respiratory infections of viral etiology, published in 2014, concluded that the technique is effective and safe, although well-designed clinical trials were advocated.17 At the time of designing this study, there were very few studies in the literature demonstrating the feasibility and efficacy of hyperimmune plasma in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and all of them reported small case series.		

What treatments are being developed in the US to combat COVID-19?
