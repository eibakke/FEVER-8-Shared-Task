The trade deficit with Canada eliminated 1,026,300 manufacturing jobs, or 29.7 percent of the total. The trade deficit with all countries eliminated 2,560,200 manufacturing jobs, or 73.5 percent of the total.

Q11: What is the relationship between the US trade deficit with China and the loss of manufacturing jobs in the US between 2001 and 2018?

Q12: How many U.S. manufacturing jobs were lost between December 2001 and December 2018?
A12: If exports to China had increased at this pace, it would have supported the creation of millions of U.S. manufacturing jobs and prevented much of the collapse of overall U.S. manufacturing employment between December 2001 and December 2018, when 2.9 million U.S. manufacturing jobs were lost (BLS 2019a).

Q13: How many U.S. jobs were lost due to the trade war with China by 2019?

However, the QA pairs state that COVID-19 can spread quickly in these communities, and the impact of that spread is great. Testing, particularly of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals, is key to interrupting this spread. The QA pairs also state that due to COVID-19 being a relatively new and understudied disease, the data available is limited. However, from the cases that emerged, it was observed that comorbidities increase the chances of infection. The QA pairs also state that testing of all people for SARS-CoV-2, including those who have no symptoms, who show symptoms of infection such as trouble breathing, fever, sore throat, or loss of the sense of smell and taste, and who may have been exposed to the virus will help prevent the spread of COVID-19 by identifying people who are in need of care in a timely fashion. The QA pairs also state that miscounting from misdiagnosis or under-reporting of COVID-19-related deaths is avoided. Excess mortality data include ‘collateral damage’ from other health conditions, left untreated if the health system is overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases, or by deliberate actions that prioritise patients with COVID-19 over those with other symptoms.
