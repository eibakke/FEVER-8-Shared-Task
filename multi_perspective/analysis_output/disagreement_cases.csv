verdict: 'Refuted'","The trade deficit with Mexico eliminated 1,143,400 manufacturing jobs over the same period, or 34.6 percent of the total. The trade deficit with Canada eliminated 1,026,300 manufacturing jobs, or 29.7 percent of the total. The trade deficit with all countries eliminated 2,560,200 manufacturing jobs, or 73.5 percent of the total.

Q11: What is the relationship between the US trade deficit with China and the loss of manufacturing jobs in the US between 2001 and 2018?
A11: The growing trade deficit with China eliminated 2,793,200 manufacturing jobs between 2001 and 2018, nearly three-fourths (75.4%) of the total.

Q12: How many U.S. manufacturing jobs were lost between December 2001 and December 2018?
A12: If exports to China had increased at this pace, it would have supported the creation of millions of U.S. manufacturing jobs and prevented much of the collapse of overall U.S. manufacturing employment between December 2001 and December 2018, when 2.9 million U.S. manufacturing jobs were lost (BLS 2019a).

Q13: How many U.S. jobs were lost due to the trade war with China by 2019?
A13: Overall, a widely cited Moody's economic analysis found that the trade war had cost 300,000 U.S. jobs by 2019, across manufacturing, wholesale, retail and other sectors.[23]

Q14: What is the relationship between the US trade deficit with China and the loss of manufacturing jobs in the US between 2001 and 2013?
A14: Trade deficits are highly correlated with job loss or displacement by industry, as shown in Table 3. The growing trade deficit with China eliminated 2,391,500 manufacturing jobs between 2001 and 2013, more than three-fourths (75.7 percent) of the total.
