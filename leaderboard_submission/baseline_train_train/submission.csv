Biden has publicly vowed not to raise taxes for those making less than $400,000 per year.

Can children spread COVID-19 even if they are not showing symptoms of the illness?		
The study, published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, raises the possibility that young kids may be able to spread COVID-19 as easily as adults, even if they aren't that sick.		

Is there an age-related difference in the likelihood of children spreading the coronavirus to their close contacts?		
Other recent research suggests that the age of children may be a factor. Data from contact tracing in South Korea suggest that older children are more likely to spread the virus to their close contacts compared to younger children, particularly in a home setting.		

What percentage of coronavirus transmissions are believed to be from children to adults or other children?		
If infected, children are believed to be less likely to infect one another or adults in their lives.

What method of payment did the U.S. Treasury Department recommend for Social Security and other federal benefit recipients to switch to before the electronic payment law went into effect in 2013?		
With just 4 days remaining until the electronic payment law goes into effect, the Treasury Department is urging remaining Social Security and other federal benefit recipients who still get paper checks to make the switch to direct deposit or the Direct Express Debit MasterCard before the deadline.		

Why did the U.S. decide to stop issuing Social Security checks by paper?		
""It costs 92 cents more to issue a payment by paper check than by direct deposit. We are retiring the Social Security paper check option in favor of electronic payments because it is the right thing to do for benefit recipients and American taxpayers alike.""		

What method of payment does the U.S. Treasury Department currently use for Social Security checks, and what is the status of paper checks for those who have not switched?

In upholding the Trump administration's travel ban, the Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which ruled in December in Trump v. Hawaii that the president had exceeded his authority in issuing the travel restrictions and that the indefinite suspension of entry for nationals of certain countries conflicts with the Immigration and Nationality Act’s prohibition on nationality-based discrimination.		

Did the Supreme Court rule that Trump's January 2018 travel ban was lawful?		
In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the legality of President Trump’s Proclamation No. 9645, commonly known as the travel ban, holding that the restrictions imposed by the policy are “squarely within the scope of Presidential authority” under current immigration law.		

What were the main arguments against Trump's January 2018 travel ban?		
Lawsuits again challenged this version of the travel ban, reaching the Supreme Court for resolution. The justices were presented with three arguments against the travel ban: the President had not made a sufficient finding that banning the entry of these nationalities would be detrimental to the national interests, the proclamation unlawfully discriminated based on nationality, and it unconstitutionally discriminated based on religion.		

Does the existence of a waiver program in the travel ban contradict the claim that Trump's January 2018 travel ban was unlawful?

What was the basis of the challenge to the third version of President Trump's travel restriction?		
- The ruling concerned the third version of President Trump's travel restriction, which was challenged on the grounds that it amounted to a ""Muslim ban.""		

Did the travel ban issued by Trump in January 2018 include all the countries that were initially blocked by the travel ban issued in September 2017?

CBO estimated that up to 27.3 million workers would see wage increases as a result of the policy. About 17.0 million of these low-wage workers would receive direct wage increases because they would otherwise earn less than $15 per hour in 2025, and up to an additional 10.3 million, who would already earn slightly above $15, would also experience some wage increases due to spillover or “ripple” effects.		

How many workers would benefit from a $15 federal minimum wage increase?		
The study estimates that such a raise would directly lift the hourly earnings of 22.5 million workers (who currently earn under $15), and another 19 million workers would benefit from a spillover effect as employers raise wages to attract and retain workers who used to make slightly above $15.

The use of corticosteroids for treating COVID-19 also presents a challenging problem. Because there is no clinical benefit in using corticosteroids to treat influenza, MERS, or SARS, the routine usage of corticosteroids for treating ARDS or shock associated with COVID-19 is not recommended by the World Health Organization (16).

Are there any proven treatments for COVID-19 as of the time the evidence was written?		
So far there is still no specific drug for COVID-19,[15–17] due to the epidemic first broke out in China, acupuncture and moxibustion, which are traditional Chinese external treatment, have been used as adjuvant treatment for it in China.		

Does drinking traditional Chinese medicine or taking steroids, along with antibiotics, cure COVID-19 as of the information provided by the World Health Organization?		
Supportive treatment remains the mainstay of therapy for COVID-19. The World Health Organization reported that four candidate drugs, including remdesivir, are ineffective or have little effect on COVID-19.		

Is there scientific evidence to support the claim that drinking traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) or steroids, along with antibiotics at the onset of symptoms cures COVID-19?

85,"There are many scientific studies saying masks should be worn only in enclosed spaces, such as in elevators and conference rooms, and not outdoors","What is the basis for the recommendation on wearing masks in outdoor spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic?		
A number of factors could influence the presence and viability of SARS-CoV-2 in outdoor spaces. Because there is insufficient evidence to assess the risk of transmission in outdoor environments, precautions must be based on what is known about SARS-CoV-2 in indoor and laboratory environments and other pathogens in outdoor environments.		

According to the World Health Organization, in what types of environments is the general public advised to wear masks?		
Current World Health Organization guidance, updated on June 5, advises governments to encourage the general public to wear masks where there is widespread transmission and physical distancing is difficult, such as on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments.		

According to the World Health Organization, what is the effectiveness of wearing masks in open spaces?		
Pandemic guidance provided by the World Health Organization for community settings advises that masks may be worn although effectiveness is uncertain particularly in open spaces [41].		

Can the available research on SARS-CoV-2 transmission be used to inform guidelines on wearing masks in outdoor environments?		
At the time of writing, there is very limited research regarding SARS-CoV-2 in outdoor environments. However, SARS-CoV-2 studies in healthcare and laboratory settings and previous research on other respiratory outbreaks can be used to frame some key questions about the risks of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in outdoor spaces.		

Do scientific studies support the claim that masks should be worn only in enclosed spaces, such as in elevators and conference rooms, and not outdoors?		
While there is some experimental evidence that masks should be able to reduce infectiousness under controlled conditions [Reference Johnson7], there is less evidence on whether this translates to effectiveness in natural settings.		

Should masks be worn in enclosed spaces to prevent the spread of COVID-19?		
In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19 transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with many potentially infectious people.		

What does the speaker think about the current mask-wearing recommendations?		
“Recommending masks only within one meter is not supported by the science,” he said. “But, I am glad to see that even if they cannot admit that aerosol transmission is important, that they included the recommendations to ‘Avoid crowded places, close-contact settings and confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation’ and to ‘Ensure good ventilation in indoor settings, including homes and offices.’”		

Do the results of the Hong Kong study and the analogy with similar viruses suggest that masks are effective in containing the spread of the virus in certain settings?		
Some indirect evidence for the benefits of masks is emerging. For example, a longitudinal ecological study from Hong Kong, conducted before and after the introduction of a range of non-pharmaceutical measures including masks for the public, suggested that these seemed to help to contain the pandemic (changes were statistically significant for masks and social distancing measures combined, though the effect of masks alone cannot be isolated out).26 There is also analogical evidence from the behaviour of viruses with a similar chemical make-up.2728		

In what situations, according to the evidence, is it recommended to wear a mask?		
While scientific evidence may support the advice to wear masks in certain circumstances, such as in public transport, closed crowded spaces or mass gatherings of any kind, where safe physical distancing cannot be continuously maintained and which should therefore be avoided if at all possible, any such recommendation should be combined with suitable information on how to use them and the potential risks of misuse.		

Do the studies mentioned in the evidence support the claim that masks should only be worn in enclosed spaces?		
Several studies have shown that wearing masks are effective in preventing spread of COVID-19 coronavirus.

In fact, the Postal Service policy is to postmark all ballots. According to a July report from the USPS’ Office of Inspector General, a postal service memo issued in 2018 “states that all ballots should be postmarked by machine or by hand.”		

Can voters request an electronically delivered mail-in ballot in the US to avoid revealing their party affiliation?		
Most mail-in ballots (also called absentee ballots) are delivered by the USPS. If a voter requests an electronically delivered absentee ballot, the ballot is delivered via a secure website.		

Do states treat absentee and mail-in ballots the same in terms of verification process?

Did the Obama administration create a pandemic response playbook that was used by the Trump administration?		
In addition, the Trump administration failed to follow a detailed pandemic response playbook put together by Obama’s National Security Council in 2016.		

Was the pandemic response team established by the Obama administration still intact in 2018?		
“Numerous posts and images circulated on social media make the claim that President Donald Trump fired the ‘entire pandemic response team’ in 2018 … The Global Health Security and Biodefense unit — responsible for pandemic preparedness — was established in 2015 by Barack Obama’s National Security Advisor, Susan Rice.

Why did the Trump administration choose not to use the 2016 Obama administration's 69-page ""pandemic playbook"" in responding to COVID-19?		
This may explain why the Trump administration chose not to use the 2016 Obama administration 69-page “pandemic playbook” in responding to COVID-19 and why Trump ordered the NSC’s Global Health Security and Biodefense unit eliminated, with some of its members assigned to other areas of the NSC and others leaving the administration entirely.		

Did the Trump administration fully implement the pandemic playbook assembled by Vice President Biden and President Obama?		
Politico reported that another factor limiting the Trump administration's ability to fully implement the 2016 pandemic playbook was that the document never underwent the proper interagency vetting and approval processes to become an official part of the White House's strategy, despite former homeland security adviser Tom Bossert expressing interest in making it a permanent fixture of the US' policy toolkit when it came to pandemics.		

What steps did the Obama administration take to prepare the country for a pandemic before Trump took office?		
The Obama administration took steps to increase the country’s readiness—writing the 2016 “pandemic playbook,” giving pandemic disease a higher profile in its last NSS, and creating the biodefense unit in the NSC staff—but there was still much work to be done when Trump took office in 2017.

93,"Sweden, which does not require the wearing of masks in public, has had few deaths due to COVID-19","Did Sweden's relaxed COVID-19 restrictions result in a higher death rate per million people compared to other countries?		
This relaxed restriction policy by the government of Sweden resulted in a higher death rate per million people, 40% more than the United States (with the highest number of death) and at least 600% more than any of the neighboring Scandinavian nations that enforced early and stricter measures.21 Sweden’s late and unorthodox lockdown measures led to a longer time to achieve a flattened COVID-19 curve compared to countries like Denmark that were quick to enact strict measures and able to flatten the curve in under four weeks.22 Similarly, a study reported that countries that initiated early lockdown (e.g., New Zealand, Hungary) fared much better than those that began lockdown after a high infection rate (e.g. Spain, Italy).		

Did Sweden experience a similar economic downturn and high numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths despite not implementing stay-at-home orders or closing businesses?		
The case of Sweden supports this hypothesis. Though Sweden did not close businesses or implement stay-at-home orders, it suffered a similar economic downturn as other Scandinavian countries while experiencing high numbers of cases and deaths resulting from COVID-19.[30]		

Did Sweden's decision not to require mask-wearing in public contribute to the number of deaths due to COVID-19?		
Sweden’s controversial decision not to lock down during COVID-19 produced more deaths and greater healthcare demand than seen in countries with earlier, more stringent interventions, a new analysis finds.		

Did Sweden's decision not to lock down during the COVID-19 pandemic result in fewer deaths compared to other countries?		
Sweden’s controversial decision not to lock down during COVID-19 produced more deaths and greater health care demand than seen in countries with earlier, more stringent interventions, a new analysis finds.		

Did Sweden's strategy of not imposing stringent public health mandates, such as mask-wearing, contribute to its COVID-19 death toll?		
Because of Sweden’s unique strategy of not imposing stringent public health mandates, we used an individual-based model parameterized on Swedish demographics to assess the impact of measures deployed against COVID-19.		

Does Sweden's policy of not requiring the wearing of masks in public contribute to the number of COVID-19 related deaths in the country?		
Despite their many similarities, the Scandinavian neighbors Sweden and Norway have had vastly different experiences of COVID-19: through July 4, according to estimates of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), where we both work, Sweden has seen more than 5,000 COVID-19 related deaths while Norway has seen fewer than 250.		

Did Sweden have a higher number of COVID-19 deaths compared to other Nordic countries?		
According to BBC News, Dr. Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s state epidemiologist in charge of the country’s response to COVID-19, said that Sweden’s death toll from the pandemic is nearly 10 times the number of deaths in other Nordic countries―half of them associated with fragile, elderly people in nursing homes, much like death patterns in the United States.		

How does the number of reported COVID-19 deaths per capita in Sweden compare to its Scandinavian neighbors and other European countries as of May 15, 2020?		
Sweden has had a similarly intermediate number of reported COVID-19 deaths—fewer per capita than Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom but more than its Scandinavian neighbors that implemented strong measures promptly and more than most other European countries (Supplementary Table 1; 35 of 100 000 in Sweden versus 9.3 in Denmark, 5.2 in Finland, and 4.7 in Norway, as of 15 May 2020).		

How does the Swedish death toll from COVID-19 compare to the UK's, despite Sweden not requiring the wearing of masks in public?		
The Swedish statistics for COVID-19 also suffer from similar problem with under-testing and may have missed about 20% of COVID-19 related deaths (ref 3) but the true death toll proportionately would still be less than in the UK and hence any inference that Sweden performed worse than the UK on deaths per million population would be obviously open to challenge.		

Is Sweden's strategy designed to reduce the likelihood of a subsequent wave of COVID-19 cases?		
Finally, while some have criticized Sweden’s less restrictive approach because it has more per capita deaths than some of its neighbors, Sweden’s strategy, according to state epidemiologist Tegnell, is designed for a better long-term outcome that lessens the likelihood of a subsequent wave .REF

Overall, herd immunity will likely never be achieved with COVID-19. The emergence of variants and the waning immunity after both vaccination and natural infection will mean populations across the globe will always be susceptible to a certain degree.		

Has the United States reached herd immunity for COVID-19?		
Herd immunity is the threshold at which a virus can no longer spread widely. However, a slew of new studies is showing that the world is still far from herd immunity even in places where the coronavirus has hit hard.

128,COVID-19 virus is airborne.,"Does the COVID-19 virus spread through the air in indoor settings with poor ventilation?		
Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is known to occur during aerosol-generating medical procedures. The scientific community has been actively discussing and evaluating whether SARS-CoV-2 may also spread through aerosols in the absence of aerosol-generating procedures, particularly in indoor settings with poor ventilation (WHO, 2020, Jun 9).		

Is there any evidence that COVID-19 virus is airborne?		
According to current evidence, COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes.2-7 In an analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, airborne transmission was not reported.7		

Is there evidence that COVID-19 virus can be transmitted through the air?		
- To date, epidemiological analyses of COVID-19 outbreaks and exposure investigations in healthcare settings have not demonstrated airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, i.e. there is little evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains infective over distance and time.		

At the time of the claim, what was the World Health Organization's stance on the primary mode of COVID-19 transmission?		
In response, the WHO published a scientific brief on July 9 acknowledging the possibility of airborne transmission, but still concluding that COVID-19 is “primarily transmitted” between people through respiratory droplets and touching, and that the question needs “further study.”		

Is COVID-19 considered to be transmitted mainly through respiratory droplets and contact, with airborne transmission also being a possible mode of transmission?		
The current consensus regarding the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is that it is transmitted mainly through respiratory droplets and contact and that airborne transmission is possible during AGPs [9, 10, 11, 25].		

How long can the COVID-19 virus remain airborne in indoor environments?		
The importance of different routes of transmission for SARS-CoV-2 is an ongoing area of research. SARS-CoV-2 can remain airborne in indoor environments for hours, potentially increasing in concentration over time.		

Is there evidence that COVID-19 can be transmitted through the air in certain environments?		
The transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 are still debated, but recent evidence strongly suggests that COVID-19 could be transmitted via air in poorly ventilated places.		

Under what circumstances is airborne transmission of COVID-19 possible?		
Based on these findings, it is believed that SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through droplets and contact, and that airborne transmission is possible under certain circumstances when aerosols are generated during AGPs or support treatment [9, 11].		

Is there evidence that the COVID-19 virus has been transmitted through the air in previous outbreaks?		
In the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, concerns have been raised over the potential airborne transmission, based, in part, on possible instances of airborne transmission of the closely related SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses (Shiu, Leung, and Cowling 2019).		

Is there evidence that COVID-19 virus is airborne?		
While the coronavirus is primarily spread through close contact from person-to-person by airborne respiratory droplets, there are currently “no data available to assess the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during dental practice,” the CDC says.

T cells have been shown to have a beneficial role in long-term COVID-19 immunity. Evidence from various studies, including the Kusnadi et al. study published in January 2021 suggests that people with severe COVID-19 gain a stronger long-term immunity due to a higher number of protective memory T cells.		

What is the current understanding of the relationship between T cell responses and the immune response against SARS-CoV-2?		
Similarly, the role of host immune responses in viral clearance of COVID-19 remains unresolved. For SARS-CoV (2002/03), however, it has been reported that CD4+ T cell responses correlated with positive outcomes3,4, whereas T cell immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been characterized.

While not a randomized control study, The Lancet article is the largest study to date on the hyped drugs, analyzing data from nearly 15,000 COVID-19 patients who received hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, or a combination of either drug with a macrolide antibiotic such as azithromycin, and 81,000 COVID-19 patients who did not receive any of those treatments.		

Is hydroxychloroquine associated with a higher risk of heart problems and death in patients with COVID-19?		
On 22 May, the Lancet published a hydroxychloroquine study involving 96,000 patients around the world which found the drug was associated with a higher risk of heart problems and death in those with Covid-19.		

Does the Lancet paper support the claim that hydroxychloroquine is associated with a lower COVID-19 mortality rate?		
As reported widely in the media, including by TCTMD, the Lancet paper was a global analysis of 96,032 patients with COVID-19 from 671 hospitals showing that use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine is linked to significantly higher risks of in-hospital mortality and new ventricular arrhythmia during hospitalization.		

What are the limitations of previous studies on hydroxychloroquine use during COVID-19?		
Previous studies on hydroxychloroquine use during COVID-19 have found contradictory results, but they were all limited by small sample size, heterogenous hydroxychloroquine dosages, no or limited therapeutic drug monitoring, or methodological flaws (6).		

Does the massive international study mentioned in the claim show a lower COVID-19 mortality rate in countries where hydroxychloroquine was prescribed to patients?		
Two large randomised trials, RECOVERY and SOLIDARITY, have shown no benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19, changing clinical practice worldwide.		

Can hydroxychloroquine be used to reduce the mortality rate of COVID-19?		
We aimed to estimate the effects of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on survival in COVID-19 from all currently available RCT evidence, published and unpublished.		

Does hydroxychloroquine show a benefit in reducing mortality or speeding recovery in patients with COVID-19?		
Recent results from a large randomized clinical trial in hospitalized patients, a population similar to the population for which chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were authorized for emergency use, demonstrated that hydroxychloroquine showed no benefit on mortality or in speeding recovery.

Have there been previous instances where the U.S. has deviated from the Taiwan Guidelines, similar to the visit of Secretary Alex Azar in August 2020?		
Some observers point out that the Taiwan Guidelines seem to have been bent on at least two other occasions without official modification—when U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, a cabinet officer, went to Taiwan in December 1992 to discuss U.S.-Taiwan trade ties, and when Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui in 1995 became the first Taiwan president since 1979 permitted to make a landmark ""unofficial"" visit to the United States.

What international rules or agreements does the 2018 passage of the Taiwan Travel Act suggest were previously in place that Alex Azar's visit to Taiwan in August 2020 may have potentially breached?

Does the USA have a higher COVID-19 case rate compared to other countries due to a higher testing rate?		
But it has a much lower testing rate of 5,445 per million compared with many other states, so the high number of cases in Maharashtra is not explained by a high test rate.		

What is the main reason for the higher number of COVID-19 cases in the USA compared to other countries?		
""That states are finding more cases relative to the amount of tests they are conducting provides the strongest rebuttal to the administration's assertion that case numbers are rising because we're getting better at finding cases through increased testing,"" Jennifer Nuzzo, lead epidemiologist of Johns Hopkins University's Covid-19 Testing Insights Initiative, wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post.		

Does the USA have more COVID-19 cases because they have a higher number of actual infections, or is it because they are conducting more tests?		
Due to limited testing capacities, mortality numbers may serve as a better indicator for COVID-19 case spread in many countries.		

Does the number of COVID-19 tests conducted in the USA correlate with the number of COVID-19 fatalities in the country?		
While the U.S. has conducted more testing than any other country, it also has the most fatalities — 136,300 of the world's approximately 576,800 deaths.

In its 2018 review, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority concluded that ""despite the lack of established mechanism[s] for affecting health with weak radio wave exposure there is however need for more research covering the novel frequency domains, used for 5G."" In August 2019, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced that the commission proposes to maintain its current RF exposure safety standards (adopted in 1996), quoting a statement from the Director of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health that ""[t]he available scientific evidence to date does not support adverse health effects in humans due to exposures at or under the current limits.""		

Does the available scientific evidence support the claim that long-term exposure to 5G millimeter waves can cause harm to the human central nervous system?		
Although Foster admitted that research on the effects of long-term exposure to 5G millimeter waves was lacking, he restated the FDA’s position that ""[t]he available scientific evidence to date does not support adverse health effects in humans due to exposures at or under the current limits.”		

Does the evidence provided suggest that exposure to 5G can cause harm to the human central nervous system?		
We have published our preliminary data on radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation, which shows that 89% (216 of 242) of experimental studies that investigated oxidative stress endpoints showed significant effects.7 This weight of scientific evidence refutes the prominent claim that the deployment of wireless technologies poses no health risks at the currently permitted non-thermal radiofrequency exposure levels.		

Does the current evidence support the claim that excessive exposure to 5G can cause harm to the human central nervous system?		
- Regarding the health effects of MMW in the 6–100 GHz frequency range at power densities not exceeding the exposure guidelines the studies provide no clear evidence, due to contradictory information from the in vivo and in vitro investigations.		

Does the evidence suggest that 5G exposure can cause significant harm to the human central nervous system?		
Yet, since the FCC adopted these limits based largely on research from the 1980s, the preponderance of peer-reviewed research, more than 500 studies, have found harmful biologic or health effects from exposure to RFR at intensities too low to cause significant heating.		

Does the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection believe that 5G poses a threat to human health?		
In the latest scientific study from the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection — an organization that the WHO specifically refers to on its website with regard to overall RF frequency-related health matters — they concluded that health-related concerns for 5G overall are not a threat.		

Can 5G exposure cause harm to the human central nervous system?		
""The exposure that 5G will produce has been considered in great depth by ICNIRP, with the restrictions set well below the lowest level of 5G-related radio frequency that has been shown to cause harm,"" says Prof Croft.

Scientific evidence invalidates health assumptions underlying the FCC and ICNIRP exposure limit determinations for radiofrequency radiation: implications for 5G.Environ Health. 2022		

Is it possible for 5G exposure to cause damage to the human central nervous system?		
However, at the levels 5G uses, this heating effect does not cause any damage, says Rodney Croft, adviser to the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection: ""The maximum radio frequency level that someone in the community could be exposed to from 5G (or any other signals in general community areas) is so small that no temperature rise has been observed to date.""		

Is there any evidence that exposure to 5G radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) can cause damage to the human central nervous system?

Did the number of abortions in Nigeria increase between 1996 and 2012?		
Two studies of the incidence of abortion in Nigeria were reported in the late 1990s. The first, based on interviews with health providers in 672 health facilities across the country, reported an abortion incidence of 610,000 abortions (nearly 25 abortions per 1000 women of reproductive age) 1.		

What was the number of abortion cases in Nigeria in 1996 compared to 2012?		
An estimated 1.25 million induced abortions occurred in Nigeria in 2012, equivalent to a rate of 33 abortions per 1000 women aged 15–49 with more than 200 000 women being managed for unsafe abortion with a high percentage developing complications.[6] High unmet need for contraception [7] and restricted abortion law in Nigeria [4] might be a contributing factor.		

What was the estimated number of induced abortions in Nigeria in 1996?		
A 1998 study estimated that 760,000 induced abortions are performed in Nigeria each year, equivalent to an annual rate of 25 per 1,000 women aged 15–44,2 and this may be an underestimate of the true incidence of the procedure.3		

Did the estimated abortion rate in Nigeria increase between 1996 and 2012?		
The estimated abortion rate was 33 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–49 in 2012. Although this rate is greater than the 1996 rate (23 per 1,000) estimated in a previous study, the most prudent conclusion may be that the abortion rate has increased slightly, as the two rates were calculated using different approaches.		

How many abortions occurred in Nigeria in 1996?		
Nevertheless, the practice is common: According to an estimate based on a 1996 national survey of physicians and hospitals in Nigeria, 610,000 abortions occurred in a one-year period, a rate of about 25 abortions per 1,000 women of childbearing age (15–44 years).1		

What is the estimated annual abortion rate in Nigeria?		
Using both the minimum and best estimates of the total annual count of abortions in Nigeria, we find that the annual abortion rate is no less than 18 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44, and more realistically is 25 per 1,000.		

Did the estimated number of abortions in Nigeria increase between 1996 and 2012?

- Put the mask on correctly with a good fit covering your mouth and nose. Face masks will not provide protection from germs and other contaminants with loose fit between the surface of the face mask and your face.		

What happens if you wear a mask in a way that does not cover your nose?		
A mask worn only over the mouth won’t contain droplets if you sneeze. If your nose is not covered by a mask, you also risk contamination from the mask itself, which collects germs on its exterior.		

Is it necessary to cover the chin when wearing a face mask?		
Face masks that are big enough to shield your chin are great, but not necessarily essential. ""The chin does not need to be covered but it is easier to get a good seal around the mouth if the chin is used to support (it), so many masks will fit snugly on the chin,"" Aronoff said.		

Can wearing a mask on your chin lead to self-contamination of the virus?		
Second, if masks are worn improperly, there can be self-contamination, where bacterial or viral particles accumulated on the outside of the mask are transferred to the hands and then potentially to the mouth or eyes41,54,75.

It is important to note that while the court ruling ended statewide disease control measures, many of Wisconsin's most populous areas put health orders in place to maintain social distancing for citizens and businesses, including Milwaukee, Eau Claire County and Dane County, home to Wisconsin's capital city of Madison.		

Did the Governor of Iowa issue a formal shelter-at-home order during the COVID-19 pandemic?		
Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, largely avoided such criticism by never issuing a formal shelter-at-home order for Iowa, similar to Republican-led states to the west, including Nebraska and Wyoming.		

Are Republican lawmakers in more than half of U.S. states reducing the powers of state and local officials to protect the public against infectious diseases?		
Republican legislators in more than half of U.S. states, spurred on by voters angry about lockdowns and mask mandates, are taking away the powers state and local officials use to protect the public against infectious diseases.		

What safety precautions have neighboring states taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 compared to Wisconsin?		
While there has been broad public support of strict stay at home orders and other social distancing measures to protect public health, there also have been protests alleging these measures impermissibly restrict individual rights in Wisconsin, Michigan, California, and elsewhere, and lawsuits challenging them filed in a number of states.		

How many states have ended their stay-at-home orders as of June 1?		
As of June 1, stay-at-home orders have ended in 35 states. Eighteen of those states have Republican governors and 17 have Democratic governors (including Wisconsin, where the state Supreme Court invalidated the stay-at-home order).		

How would the COVID-19 safety measures in neighboring states compare to the federal government's policy if the federal government were to relax social distancing guidelines?		
But if the federal government were to relax social distancing guidelines, the states' COVID-19 measures (at least in their current form) would be more restrictive, not ""insufficient"" vis-à-vis the federal government's policy, to stopping the spread of the disease.		

Have neighboring states of Wisconsin implemented more safety precautions against the spread of COVID-19 than Wisconsin?		
In at least 16 states, legislators have limited the power of public health officials to order mask mandates, or quarantines or isolation.		

Are there any safety precautions in place in Wisconsin to prevent the spread of COVID-19?		
Gov. Tony Evers has directed state health officials to issue a stay-at-home order for Wisconsin prohibiting non-essential travel, with some exceptions, amid the continued spread of COVID-19 in the state.		

Did Wisconsin Democrats claim that neighboring states have implemented more safety precautions against the spread of COVID-19 than the state GOP, despite the state restrictions in Wisconsin being relaxed?		
“Even as the state restrictions [in Wisconsin] were relaxed, the more significant population centers, the cities, kept restrictions in place,” she said.

One study showed that masks were associated with headaches, vague discomfort, and acne, although the headaches were significantly associated with pre-existing headaches21.		

What are the topics that the studies by Lim, et al. and Foo, et al. focused on?		
A study by Lim, et al. focused on headaches related to mask use [1], and another study by Foo, et al. discussed adverse skin reactions such as rashes, acne, and itching from mask use [2].		

Has there been any research on the effectiveness of wearing masks in relation to cognitive function or intelligence?		
Finally, the post falsely states that the effectiveness of masks has not been studied. In June, The Associated Press reported on a peer-reviewed study funded by the World Health Organization in The Lancet.		

Does the study suggest a correlation between mask wearers and IQ?		
A recent study published in March 2015 edition of the American Journal of Psychiatry suggests that not only there is no correlation between high IQ and schizophrenia, but rather that a high IQ may be protective against the illness.[45]		

Does the study in the evidence relate to the effectiveness of masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19 or their impact on cognitive abilities?		
First, the study is on different diseases in different conditions (see last two paragraphs). Second, the study tested the effectiveness of masks at protecting the wearer (in this case healthcare workers), rather than source control, which is the primary purpose of masks in the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the subgroups based on different study designs, protective effects of wearing mask were significant in cluster randomized trials and observational studies.		

Can the study's conclusion that mask wearers have lower IQ be supported by the evidence that it lacked a ""no mask"" control group?		
Third, the study did not have a ""no mask"" control, so they have no way of comparing cloth mask with no mask.		

Can the study's findings establish a causal link between mask-wearing and lower IQ, or are they merely indicative of an association?		
But once again, such studies could only show associations and not cause and effect. Additionally, while this new JAMA Pediatrics study seems to have been a well-done observational study, many of the past observational studies have been shaky at best.		

What do studies suggest about the effectiveness of masks in relation to health?

Does the claim that mandatory vaccinations is in direct violation of the Nuremberg Code have any basis in fact, given that the posts do not provide any evidence to support this claim?		
The posts go on to claim that “forced, coerced and mandated vaccination” violates the principles of the Nuremberg Code and that officers enforcing laws related to vaccines could face war crime charges.		

Does the Nuremberg Code specify that the risk of a medical experiment should be proportionate to its humanitarian importance?

Unlike the Nuremberg Code, this statement, known as the Declaration of Helsinki, recognizes that research may be conducted on people with ""legal incapacity to consent.		

Does the Nuremberg Code provide any provisions that would allow for mandatory vaccinations, or does it emphasize the importance of individual consent?		
The 1948 Nuremberg Code is the first ethical code to establish the basic standards for when human beings may be enrolled in scientific studies, including informed consent, a balancing between plausible benefits to humanity and harm to individuals, and the individual’s right to disenroll at any time.		

Does the Nuremberg Code require voluntary consent from human subjects in medical research?

276,"Greenhouse gases emitted into the ocean are causing more holes in the ozone layer; the ozone layer has holes in it, causing global temperatures to rise.","What is the relationship between greenhouse gases emitted into the ocean and the rise in global temperatures?		
While ozone can affect climate, the rise in global temperature is the result of human-caused emissions of CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, and other greenhouse gases that trap and re-emit infra-red radiation, not by causing holes in the ozone layer as claimed (see figure below)[1,3,4].		

What are the substances that cause holes in the stratospheric ozone layer?		
Factually inaccurate: Chlorofluorocarbons, halons, and other ozone-depleting substances cause holes in the stratospheric ozone layer, not the greenhouse gas CO2, which was referred to in the post by stating it is emitted into the ocean.		

Is the claim that greenhouse gases emitted into the ocean are causing more holes in the ozone layer accurate, given that ozone depletion is not the principal cause of global climate change?		
No, ozone depletion is not the principal cause of global climate change. Ozone depletion and global climate change are linked because both ozone-depleting substances and their substitutes are greenhouse gases.		

What is the relationship between the Antarctic ozone hole and global climate change?		
While increasing greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) are the primary drivers of global climate change, the Antarctic ozone hole, which has occurred every spring since the early 1980s, was shown to contribute to observed changes in Southern Hemisphere (SH) surface climate during summer due to the effect of the ozone hole on atmospheric circulation.		

What is the relationship between greenhouse gases emitted into the ocean and the formation of holes in the ozone layer?		
While increasing greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) are the primary drivers of global climate change, the Antarctic ozone hole, which has occurred every spring since the early 1980s, was shown to contribute to observed changes in Southern Hemisphere surface climate during summer due to its effects on atmospheric circulation.		

What is the relationship between greenhouse gases and the formation of holes in the ozone layer?		
The greenhouse effect and ozone hole issues are, however, related. For example, CFCs are involved in both issues: CFCs, in addition to destroying stratosphere ozone, are also greenhouse gases.		

Is there a relationship between global warming and the functioning of the ozone layer?		
Although global warming and ozone depletion are caused by different gases, scientists have shown that a warming planet may change how the stratosphere—and, therefore, the ozone layer—works.		

What is the relationship between greenhouse gases and the ozone layer?		
Ozone is also a greenhouse gas, so stratospheric ozone depletion leads to surface cooling. Conversely, increases in tropospheric ozone and other greenhouse gases lead to surface warming.		

Are chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) the cause of the depletion of the ozone layer?		
When scientists first suggested that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were depleting the ozone layer, NOAA led studies that elucidated the processes involved in global ozone depletion and determined the cause of the Antarctic ozone hole.		

Does the evidence support the claim that greenhouse gases emitted into the ocean are causing more holes in the ozone layer, leading to global temperature increases?		
Ozone layer depletion and climate change are linked in a number of ways, but ozone depletion is not a direct or major cause of climate change.

But while some news outlets are saying that NASA found a 13th constellation that shifts the dates of the 12 other signs, the space agency offered a fact check: it didn't change any zodiac signs, it was just doing math on how the ancient Babylonians measured the sky.		

Did NASA change the traditional zodiac by adding a new sign, and if so, what was the basis for this change?		
NASA added the thirteenth sign, Ophiuchus, and actually noted the dates when the sun actually passes through each sign, rather than dividing them up evenly and arbitrarily.		

Has NASA officially recognized Ophiuchus as a new zodiac sign?		
However, Ophiuchus is not new. In fact, astrologers have known about the constellation for hundreds of years, and the idea that it should become an official zodiac sign was first floated back in the 1970s.		

When did the idea of a 13th star sign named ""Ophiuchus"" originate?		
Despite the buzz surrounding Ophiuchus’ allegedly 'new' inclusion among the stars, the idea for a new sign seems to have originated as far back as 1970, when astrologer Stephen Schmidt proposed a new, 14 sign zodiac.		

Did NASA add a 13th star sign named ""Ophiuchus"" to the zodiac?		
Earth actually travels through 13 signs, including Capricorn, Aries, and, yes, Ophiuchus, but some 3,000 years ago the Babylonians—not NASA—decided 12 was neater than 13, so excluded the 13th zodiac sign and divided the zodiac into 12 parts based on the 12 months of their calendar, according to NASA.

What do the World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and The New England Journal of Medicine say about the health effects of wearing face masks?		
The claim is misleading; wearing face masks will not cause fungal lung infections or harm human health if they are handled correctly, an epidemiologist said; the World Health Organization (WHO) states wearing face masks for long periods is safe providing wearers regularly change or wash their masks if they become wet or soiled.		

Did the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advise against wearing face masks as of March 28, 2020?		
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also consistently advised the public not to use face masks unless sick or caring for someone sick and denied that any updated mask guidance was scheduled as of March 28, 2020 [ ].		

What do medical experts from the World Health Organization (WHO), US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and The New England Journal of Medicine say about wearing face masks?		
Despite public health officials around the world urging individuals to wear face masks to prevent further spread of COVID-19, there have been several claims posted on social media and printed on posters that suggest wearing a face mask is more dangerous to the wearer’s health than contracting the virus.		

What do the World Health Organization, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and The New England Journal of Medicine advise regarding the use of face masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19?		
The WHO's guidance on the use of medical masks makes clear that their use alone is insufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 without proper hand-washing and other measures to protect against human to human transmission.

291,CORONAVIRUS IS A LAB-ENGINEERED BIOWEAPON,"What is the current assessment of the claim that COVID-19 may have originated in a Chinese lab?		
We rate the claim that COVID-19 may have originated in a Chinese lab as PARTLY FALSE. Suggestions that the novel coronavirus was engineered for use in bioweapons in a high-security biomedical laboratory in Wuhan, China, were debunked, based on scientific research since the virus began its global spread.		

Is the scientific consensus that the coronavirus is not a lab-engineered bioweapon supported by the genetic data?		
The scientific consensus rejecting the virus being engineered is almost unanimous. In a letter to Nature in March, a team in California led by microbiology professor Kristian Andersen said “the genetic data irrefutably shows that [Covid-19] is not derived from any previously used virus backbone” – in other words spliced sections of another known virus.		

Does the available scientific evidence support the claim that the Coronavirus is a lab-engineered bioweapon?		
Last month, a study published in the scientific journal Nature Medicine analyzed the available evidence and determined the novel coronavirus ""is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,"" with the researchers concluding, ""We do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.""		

Is the COVID-19 virus a laboratory-engineered bioweapon?		
An analysis published in Nature Medicine on 17 Mar. 2020 further supports our conclusion that the virus causing COVID-19 has a natural origin[8], stating that: “Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.”		

Is the theory that SARS-CoV-2 was manufactured in, and escaped from, a lab in Wuhan based on geographical proximity?		
The theory that SARS-CoV-2 was manufactured in, and escaped from, a lab in Wuhan is based solely on the proximity of infectious-disease labs near a potential source of the COVID-19 outbreak.		

Is the novel coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus?		
But the scientific research continues. On March 17, Nature published a paper that strongly countered the “bioweapon” theories, concluding that Sars-CoV-2, the official name of the novel coronavirus, is “clearly … not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus”.		

Is there a theory that the COVID-19 virus originated from a laboratory?		
The conspiracy theory that SARS-CoV-2 actually came from a laboratory has gained traction in recent months, with many accounts blaming the pandemic on a leak (or malicious release) from the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China near where the virus was first detected.		

Is SARS-CoV-2 a laboratory-engineered bioweapon?		
""Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,"" the article reads.		

Is the novel coronavirus a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus?		
An analysis of the evidence, according to the findings first published in the scientific journal Nature Medicine, shows that the novel coronavirus ""is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,"" with the researchers concluding ""we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.""		

Is there evidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was involved in the creation or manipulation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?		
The Wuhan Institute of Virology has been the subject of baseless conspiracy theories claiming SARS-CoV-2 was created or manipulated in a lab.

The WHO ""walked that back because there's no evidence to indicate that's the case,"" Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during an interview that aired on ABC's ""Good Morning America.""		

Did Anthony Fauci say that COVID-19 is ""just a virus"" and that everyone will get it eventually?

Did Anthony Fauci ever say that COVID-19 is ""just a virus"" and that everyone will get it eventually?		
PolitiFact has fact-checked several misleading claims about what Fauci has said. Here is a summary of Fauci in his own words on the travel ban, wearing masks, the size of the threat, and the risk of asymptomatic transmission.		

What is Dr. Anthony Fauci's stance on the COVID-19 pandemic?		
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a Friday interview on D.C.-based radio station WTOP he is concerned that the widespread protests taking place across the country could raise the risk of new COVID-19 outbreaks as the country seeks to re-open.		

What was Anthony Fauci's stance on the COVID-19 virus in response to President Trump's downplaying of the virus?		
The White House's attempt to marginalize Fauci and limit his press appearances comes after months of Trump downplaying the virus -- even going so far in February to claim that ""one day -- it's like a miracle -- it will disappear"" -- Fauci has emphasized ""the virus dictates the timeline.""		

What stance does Dr. Anthony Fauci believe people should take regarding the COVID-19 virus?		
If Dr Anthony Fauci says it, Americans would be smart to listen. As the coronavirus has upended daily life across the globe, Fauci, the US director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has become the trusted voice in the United States in separating fact and fiction.		

What did Anthony Fauci say about the COVID-19 virus in January, weeks before the first reported death in the U.S.?

- Federal building electrification and energy efficiency mandate. Although federal buildings make up a small share of total floor space in the United States, an executive order mandating complete electrification; full energy efficiency retrofits for existing buildings; and a net-zero design for all future construction would provide model solutions for the rest of the sector.		

Does the concept of ""net zero"" buildings involve the removal of windows?		
Net zero buildings can involve all Drawdown solutions modeled, including the installation of better insulation, high performance windows, more efficient lighting, heat pumps, efficient water heating, optimized building system controls, distributed renewable energy systems, etc.[1] Since these solutions were modeled separately, net zero buildings were not modeled independently in order to avoid double-counting.		

Does Donald Trump claim that incorporating energy-efficient strategies into the design, construction, and operation of new buildings would mean no windows?		
The building sector can significantly reduce energy use by incorporating energy-efficient strategies into the design, construction, and operation of new buildings and undertaking retrofits to improve the efficiency of existing buildings.

327,"The Biden-Sanders agenda proposes to end cash bail, releasing dangerous criminals onto US streets.","Does the Biden-Sanders agenda aim to address the ineffectiveness of cash bail in ensuring that accused individuals appear in court?		
Behind many of the proposals is a growing recognition that cash bail is inequitable and isn’t effective in assuring the people who are accused actually go to court to answer the charges, said Eric Sterling, executive director of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for changes in the criminal justice system.		

What is the proposed change to the current bail system under the Biden-Sanders agenda?		
End cash bail. Biden pledges to “lead a national effort to end cash bail and reform our pretrial system by putting in place, instead, a system that is fair and does not inject further discrimination or bias into the process.”		

Does the Biden-Sanders agenda support the elimination of cash bail in the US?		
Gillibrand is a cosponsor of the No Cash Bail Act, legislation that would eliminate the cash bail system at the federal level and encourage states to reform their pretrial systems by using alternative practices that prohibit the use of cash bail.		

What is the goal of jurisdictions in redesigning their pretrial systems in the context of ending cash bail?		
In ending cash bail, jurisdictions are redesigning their pretrial systems with the goal of reducing the overuse and misuse of jails.

What is the main argument made by criminal justice reform advocates regarding the current cash bail system?		
Many criminal justice reform advocates have cited evidence that the cash bail system unfairly targeted the poor, forcing those who could not post bail to languish in jail while awaiting trial.		

What changes did the 1984 crime bill make to the federal bail system in the United States?		
The act curbed the use of monetary bail in the federal system and shifted the focus of judicial consideration in pretrial release to defendants’ likelihood of returning to court (that is, their flight risk).3 In 1984, a new crime bill overhauled the federal bail system, allowing judges to consider dangerousness or the impact a defendant’s release would have on the safety of others.4		

How do pretrial risk assessment tools and the elimination of cash bail affect the release of defendants in the US?

339,South Africans have the right to resist isolation or quarantine if found to hsve the virus,"What rights are enshrined in section 27 of the South African Constitution?		
The right to health is enshrined in section 27 of the South African Constitution (“Constitution”). In the case of forced testing and quarantine, the constitutional rights of the public must be balanced against the individual’s rights.		

Does the South African government's lockdown regulations allow for individuals to resist isolation or quarantine if they test positive for COVID-19?		
Thus the lockdown regulations which allow for a person to be tested and treated for COVID-19 without their consent are supported by the common law and the National Health Care Act and do not violate the constitutional right to bodily integrity.		

Is the right to resist isolation or quarantine based on law in South Africa?		
According to these principles, any restriction on human rights must be based in law. The National Health Act No. 61 of 2003,[9] via regulations relating to the surveillance and the control of notifiable medical conditions, makes provision for testing, quarantine and isolation for notifiable diseases.		

What South African constitutional rights are at risk of being violated if a person is subjected to long-term isolation without adequate safeguards?		
The South African Medical Research Council has argued that long-term isolation without adequate safeguards could violate South African constitutional rights, including the right to dignity and the right to freedom of movement.[61]		

Does South Africa's law allow for the forced isolation or quarantine of individuals with the virus, or can they resist it?		
Regulation 7(2) of the revised lockdown regulations issued in terms of the Disaster Management Act 57 of 2002 (Government Notice R480 of 29 April 2020) clearly provides that a person refusing to go to an isolation site or quarantine facility may be compelled by a court order issued by a magistrate, in whose jurisdiction such a person is, to quarantine themselves, to go to an isolation/quarantine facility, or submit to a medical examination.		

Does the constitutional right to bodily integrity in South Africa imply that individuals have the right to refuse testing or treatment for COVID-19?		
South Africans have a constitutional right to bodily integrity, which makes medical intervention without their consent unlawful – but does this give anyone the right to refuse testing or treatment for COVID-19?		

Does the government have the authority to require quarantine, isolation, and treatment without violating the constitutional rights of South Africans?		
The government has the legal authority to require quarantine, isolation, and treatment, but it must guarantee that those affected by these actions will receive due process and that isolation and quarantine do not violate any other constitutional provisions, such as equal protection.		

Does the South African government's lockdown regulations allow for the right of South Africans to resist isolation or quarantine if found to have the virus?		
An example relevant to the current COVID-19 crisis is regulation 7(2) of the gazetted lockdown regulations authorising compelled isolation, quarantine or medical examination.		

What rights does international law impose on governments in relation to public health goals?		
The use of compulsory measures to achieve public health goals is, however, problematic.8 International law, and in particular, human rights law, imposes on governments the duty to promote and protect human rights, such as the right to privacy, the right to be free from inhuman or degrading treatment, and the right to freedom of movement.		

Can the government limit the constitutional rights of South Africans to resist isolation or quarantine during a pandemic?		
The government's right to limit any of these constitutional rights during a pandemic by enforcing quarantine orders must be considered against its own constitutional obligation to take reasonable measures to achieve the realisation of these rights within available resources.

The number of publicly reported deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may underestimate the pandemic’s death toll.		

Did the number of reported COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. account for the total number of excess deaths in the U.S. during the first 3 months of the US coronavirus epidemic?		
In the first 3 months of the US coronavirus epidemic, the number of excess deaths in the United States was 122,300, 28% higher than the reported number of COVID-19 deaths, according to an observational study published today in JAMA Internal Medicine.		

What was the COVID-19 situation in the United States as of June 8, 2020?		
The United States, by contrast, has pursued a very different path with very different results. The United States has reported nearly 2 million U.S. COVID-19 cases and over 110,000 deaths, as of June 8, with tens of thousands of new cases and between 500 and 1,500 new deaths reported every day.		

What percentage of excess deaths in California in early July 2020 were attributed to COVID-19?

Can people develop fungal lung infections if they handle face masks incorrectly?		
568. Face masks do not cause fungal lung infections if handled correctly, health experts say		

Is there a link between wearing face masks and the development of fungal lung infections?		
“There’s no evidence of masks leading to fungal or bacterial infections of the upper airway or the lower airway as in pneumonia,” said Davidson Hamer, infectious disease specialist and professor of global health and medicine at Boston University.		

What type of infections can wearing face masks cause?		
CLAIM: Wearing face masks can cause fungal and bacterial pneumonia.		

Does wearing face masks increase the risk of developing fungal lung infections?		
There is no evidence indicating that masks increase the wearer’s risk of developing pneumonia or other bacterial, viral, or fungal lung infections.		

Does wearing a face mask have a protective effect against infections, including fungal lung infections?		
Some studies produced unclear results, but the findings overall indicated that wearing a mask protected people from infections compared to not wearing a mask, especially when paired with hand-washing.		

What is the minimum airborne concentration of fungal spores required to cause fungal lung infections in people who wear face masks?		
An article reported fungal infections despite no fungal growth by air sampling [49]. Thus, the minimal airborne concentration of spores needed for acquisition of fungal infections remains to be determined.		

Does wearing a face mask cause fungal lung infections?		
""Wearing a mask does not cause fungal infections in the lungs,"" said Dr. Ranit Mishori, professor of family medicine at Georgetown University School of Medicine.		

Can prolonged use of N-95 masks lead to a build-up of carbon dioxide levels in the body, potentially causing health issues in people with pre-existing lung conditions?		
There is some evidence, however, that prolonged use of N-95 masks in patients with preexisting lung disease could cause some build-up of carbon dioxide levels in the body.		

Are fungi detected in patients who wear face masks?		
In addition to bacteria, fungi are detected in a significant number of patients. The impact of fungal colonization of the airways is still not completely elucidated, but an increasing body of evidence suggests an important role for moulds and yeasts.

394,"""Now Even The COMMON COLD Is Being Counted As A Positive COVID-19 Result.","Can a diagnosis of common cold viruses such as 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 be considered as a positive COVID-19 result?		
A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.		

Are the results of the study indicating that the common cold is being counted as a positive COVID-19 result?		
The study looked at four types of coronavirus that cause the common cold — not SARS-CoV-2. And, of 69 trivalent flu vaccine recipients, only one tested positive for a coronavirus — which Health Feedback notes is “insufficient to draw any causal association between the flu shot and coronavirus detection.”		

Are all positive COVID-19 test results confirmed to be caused by the COVID-19 virus?		
A laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case was defined as a person with a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, from a respiratory specimen, using real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction testing.		

Can a person still test positive for COVID-19 even after their symptoms have resolved?		
The updated criteria reflect recent findings that patients whose symptoms have resolved may still test positive for the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) by RT-PCR for many weeks.		

Why are some COVID-19 test results showing positive results for a condition that is not COVID-19?		
A spokesperson for the Food and Drug Administration further told us that all FDA-authorized tests for COVID-19 are specifically checked for cross-reactivity with influenza virus or influenza antibodies and that, to date, there has been no such cross-reactivity observed for any of the tests.		

Can COVID-19 tests be affected by antibodies from other coronaviruses, such as those that cause the common cold?		
These assumptions urgently require further study to understand whether they are accurate. Additionally, false-positive results – that is, a test showing that a person is infected when they are not – could occur if the antibodies on the test strip also recognize antigens of viruses other than COVID-19, such as from human coronaviruses that cause the common cold.		

What types of tests are used to diagnose active COVID-19 infections?		
What is it? There are currently three types of tests for COVID-19: molecular, antigen, and serology. Molecular tests and a new antigen test help diagnose active COVID-19 infections, and serology tests help determine whether someone was previously exposed to the novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19.		

What does a negative COVID-19 test result indicate when a person has symptoms?		
For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness.		

Are common cold coronaviruses being mistaken for COVID-19?		
No. The coronaviruses detected by commercial RVPs are common circulating strains that generally cause self-limited disease; these tests do not cross-react with SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus first identified in late 2019 that causes COVID-19 disease.		

Can COVID-19 be accurately diagnosed based on symptoms alone?		
Some symptoms of COVID-19 overlap with those of the common cold, allergies, and the flu. That can make it tricky to diagnose without a test.

Antarctica has experienced air temperature increases of 3°C in the Antarctic Peninsula. Although that might not seem very much, it is 5 times the mean rate of global warming as reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).		

Has the South Pole experienced a higher rate of warming than the global average over the past three decades?		
Temperature data shows that the desolate region has warmed at three times the global warming rate over the last three decades up through 2018, the South Pole's hottest year on record, the researchers report in a study published Monday in Nature Climate Change.		

What regions have experienced the most significant warming in surface air temperatures since the 1990s?		
The greatest warming is centered on the Antarctic Peninsula with values exceeding 0.3°C decade−1. While these warming rates indicate a warming of more than 1.3°C over the 1958–2002 period, they are relatively small when compared to some Northern Hemisphere land areas (Chapman and Walsh 1993, updated at http://arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu), which have rates of warming more than twice this magnitude.		

How have surface air temperatures in Antarctica changed since the 1990s compared to the global average?		
During the last part of the past century air temperatures in the Antarctic Peninsula increased at a faster rate than the rest of Antarctica and the globe (Vaughan et al., 2003; Turner et al., 2014).		

How much faster have surface air temperatures risen at the bottom of the world compared to the global average since the 1990s?		
Looking at data from 20 weather stations across Antarctica, the South Pole warming rate was seven times higher than the overall average for the continent.		

How much faster has the rate of warming been at the south pole compared to the rest of Antarctica since the 1990s?		
However, this rate of warming was not consistent across Antarctica. The results find the rate of warming at the south pole was seven times higher than across the continent as a whole.		

How much faster have surface air temperatures at the South Pole risen compared to the global average since the 1990s?		
The South Pole has warmed at over three times the global rate since 1989, according to a paper published in Nature Climate Change today (29 June 2020).		

Has the Antarctic continent as a whole warmed at a rate three times faster than the global average since the 1990s?		
While surface observations show that the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed in recent decades, the corresponding trends over the remainder of the Antarctic continent are more problematic.		

How does the rate of warming in the Arctic compare to the global average rate of warming since the 1990s?		
Comiso’s new study presents some striking trends. When compared to longer- term, ground-based surface temperature data, the rate of warming in the Arctic from 1981 to 2001 is eight times larger than the rate of Arctic warming over the last 100 years.		

How much has the global surface air temperature increased since 1861?		
An analysis of observational records shows that the global surface air temperature (SAT) has increased by 0.6°C since 1861, with a slightly higher rate of warming in the twentieth century (Jones et al. 1999).

411,Democrat-controlled states suffered the harshest restriction in the US during the coronavirus pandemic.,"What measures did the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker use to determine the strictness of the policies introduced to fight the pandemic across countries?		
To measure the strictness of the policies introduced to fight the pandemic across countries, we use the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT), which provides information on several measures, including school and workplace closings, travel restrictions, bans on public gatherings, and stay-at-home requirements.		

Did governors in Democrat-controlled states issue stay-at-home orders as a last resort to combat COVID-19?		
As seen in FIGURE 1, the total number of executive actions taken in states across the nation peaked before the state issued a stay-at-home order, indicating that governors may have used such orders as a last resort to combat COVID-19 in their states.		

Which US states implemented early lockdown measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus?		
Some states, such as California, implemented early lockdown measures and had more success in curbing the virus’s spread.		

Did governors in Democrat-controlled states implement more executive actions at the start of the COVID-19 crisis?		
However, at the start of the COVID-19 crisis, governors up for reelection, on average, implemented slightly more executive actions.		

What types of restrictions were put in place by states in the US to prevent the spread of the coronavirus?		
The increase in deaths and infections comes as states across the country have begun relaxing restrictions put in place to prevent the virus's spread, including the closure of nonessential businesses.		

How did the performance of Democratic-controlled states compare to Republican-controlled states in terms of coronavirus pandemic restrictions at the beginning and end of the timeframe?		
While Republican-controlled states have stronger average performance on four of the seven metrics at the beginning of the timeframe, Democratic-controlled states have stronger average performance on six of the seven metrics by the end of the timeframe.		

What specific restrictions were used to determine that Democrat-controlled states suffered the harshest restrictions in the US during the coronavirus pandemic?		
The study used weighted metrics to compare restrictions. It observed mask requirements, travel restrictions, gathering restrictions, school and restaurant closures, the ability for non-essential businesses and child care to open, exceptions to the stay-at-home order, if the state had agreements with other states, availability of elective medical procedures and if the state legislature had been suspended.		

What types of restrictions were imposed by governors and health departments across the US during the coronavirus pandemic?		
Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, governors and health departments across the country issued orders and recommendations on the status of schools, businesses and public services.		

What is the public's concern regarding the lifting of coronavirus restrictions in the US?		
As states grapple with the process of lifting restrictions, the public strikes a cautious tone: 68% say their greater concern is that states will lift restrictions too quickly, rather than not quickly enough.		

What types of restrictions were imposed in the US during the coronavirus pandemic?		
With the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines in late 2020, the closures, capacity limits and large-scale mask orders that marked earlier phases of the pandemic gave way to vaccine and testing mandates and more targeted face-covering rules, which many states extended or reinstated as the delta and omicron variants spread in 2021 and 2022.

413,The US Democratic Party has a owned and controlled corporate media monopoly.,"What is the relationship between the ownership of media outlets and the diversity of media in the US?		
But the gloss of diversity masks an underlying uniformity in media ownership and control. A number of scholars and journalists have pointed out that in many media sectors, ownership concentration is actually increasing, and many of these new entities are owned or supported by the very legacy media companies they purportedly displace.9Close Indeed, old media and telecommunication giants, including AT&T, Verizon, Disney, Comcast, Time Warner, and others, have quietly invested millions of dollars into these new outlets, sometimes even buying them outright.		

What is the nature of the ownership and funding of most media outlets in the US?		
Most media outlets are owned by a handful of conservative corporations and individuals, and funded by usually economically conservative advertisers…This pro-corporate conservative bias of the media is well-documented and shows itself in consistent under-reporting or ignoring of any information that would lead people to question the fundamental status quo.		

What is the relationship between corporate control of media outlets and the potential for broadcasting propaganda that aligns with corporate interests?		
Media outlets that are controlled by a small number of corporations often broadcast propaganda that aligns with the interests of those corporations.		

What is the ownership structure of U.S. media outlets?		
With U.S. media outlets overwhelmingly owned by for-profit conglomerates and supported by corporate advertisers, independent journalism is compromised.		

Does the US Democratic Party have a significant amount of control over the media outlets in the US?		
These views coincide with research on media ownership concentration, which characterizes the region as one in which the majority of media outlets, particularly print and broadcast, have been privately owned by a small share of powerful political and economic groups.33		

Does the study by Yochai Benkler and his coauthors suggest that the US Democratic Party has a owned and controlled corporate media monopoly?		
A trailblazing study by Yochai Benkler and his coauthors found that media organizations such as Fox News, Newsmax, Daily Caller, Breitbart, and other outlets comprise a right-wing echo chamber sealed off from the rest of the news media system.		

Does the US Democratic Party have a complete monopoly on corporate media ownership?		
While it is true that several corporations control the majority of US media, the exact percentage is not that high, according to the watchdog group Free Press.

414,"The next major advantage of the pandemic for the Deep State was the case made to the public for mail-in voting, a highly insecure practice proven to be rampant with fraud.","Is there evidence that mail-in voting has resulted in significant fraud in the United States?		
It is a baseless claim: Mail-in voting has resulted in little fraud in the five states that have used it for years, and a recent study at Stanford University found that voting by mail did not advantage either party and might increase voter turnout for both parties.		

What is the relationship between the increase in mail voting and the rate of voter fraud in the United States?		
Despite this dramatic increase in mail voting over time, fraud rates remain infinitesimally small. None of the five states that hold their elections primarily by mail has had any voter fraud scandals since making that change.		

Is mail-in voting in the US associated with widespread voter fraud?		
Facts First: While rare instances of voter fraud from mail-in ballots do occur, it is nowhere near a widespread problem in the US election system.		

Is there any evidence to support the claim that mail-in voting is a highly insecure practice proven to be rampant with fraud?		
Historically, there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud through mail-in voting. But social media users are already pushing grandiose theories casting doubt on the method.		

Does the evidence support the claim that mail-in voting is a highly insecure practice proven to be rampant with fraud?		
""Expanding voting by mail will be a challenge in most states in 2020,"" they write. ""But we reiterate: There is no evidence that mail-balloting results in rampant voter fraud, nor that election officials lack the knowledge about how to protect against abuses.""		

Is mail-in voting associated with widespread voter fraud?		
The report finds that assertions regarding mass voter fraud are verifiably false, and that concerns about mail-in ballot abuse are significantly disproportionate to its frequency.		

Is mail-in voting associated with a higher rate of voter fraud compared to in-person voting at polling places?		
While no U.S. government agency officially compiles state-by-state data on voter fraud, and requirements for mail-in voting vary by state, analysis by elections experts shows that fraud is slightly more common with mail-in voting than in-person voting at polling places.		

Is mail-in voting associated with a higher rate of voter fraud compared to in-person voting at polling places?		
(Research by political science experts show that voter fraud is slightly more common with mail-in voting than in-person voting at polling places, but the country's total number of voter-fraud cases is minuscule in comparison to the number of ballots cast; therefore, it's problematic, or at best misleading, to put numbers for each voting method up against each other.)		

Is there evidence that mail-in voting is a highly insecure practice with rampant fraud?		
Proponents of voting by mail pushed back, arguing that there is little evidence of fraudulent ballots and that no system is perfect.		

Did the COVID-19 pandemic lead to an increase in mail-in voting in the US?		
As states scrambled to reform their voting systems to meet rules on social distancing during the COVID-19 crisis, the president railed against mail-in voting, spreading false claims that the voting method invites illegal activity.

This article asserts that the PCR tests to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 (which causes Covid-19) is scientifically meaningless.		

What type of COVID-19 tests are considered the ""gold standard"" according to the evidence?		
PCR Tests: PCR tests are the “gold standard” for COVID-19 tests. They are a type of nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), which are more likely to detect the virus than antigen tests.		

Even if a COVID-19 PCR test is 90% accurate, what percentage of test results may still be false?		
A commentary published in April in Mayo Clinic Proceedings criticized the reliance on PCR tests, saying that even when tests are 90 percent accurate, that still leaves a substantial number of false test results.		

Do COVID-19 (Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests provide quantitative results?		
The tests to detect SARS-Cov-2 by real-time RT- PCR are based on a qualitative approach since the results, though dependent on a numerical value for Ct, are reported as “presence/absence of the target analyte”		

What are some of the limitations of the real-time PCR test kits used to diagnose COVID-19?		
Although the virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-Cov-2]) nucleic acid real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test has become the standard method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, these real-time PCR test kits have many limitations.		

What is the sensitivity and specificity of the PCR test for COVID-19?		
Despite these limitations, the available evidence demonstrates that the PCR test has a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 99% when performed up to five weeks after maternal diagnosis.		

Are the results of COVID-19 (Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests reliable?		
Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the PCR tests used to identify so-called COVID-19 patients presumably infected by what is called SARS-CoV-2 do not have a valid gold standard to compare them with.		

What type of test do COVID-19 (Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests use to detect the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?		
Polymerase chain reaction tests — PCR tests — are a type of nucleic acid test. These tests detect the presence of the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.		

What is the specificity of COVID-19 PCR tests?		
Because they detect molecules that are specific to SARS-CoV-2, the specificity of nucleic acid tests for COVID-19 is very high, meaning that a positive result can generally be trusted.		

What is the global sensitivity and specificity of the PCR test for COVID-19?		
This review found that the PCR test had a global sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 98.3%; however, these measurements display strong evidence of heterogeneity (I2 = 66.5% for sensitivity), which makes difficult to interpret these summary estimates.

Lawmakers in at least eight other states have proposed their own public option measures this year. Earlier this month, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, signed a bill putting his state on track to create the first public option health insurance program in the country, using a hybrid system where private insurers would offer state-defined plans.		

Is Washington the only state to implement a public option health insurance plan?		
In May 2019, Washington became the first and only state to approve a public option (Exhibit 5).

Health care costs have a significant impact on people’s income. A recent study found that although a median-income family of four’s monthly income increased by $1,910 from 1999 to 2009, this gain was offset to a great extent by increased spending on health care ($820, or 43% of the income growth), including health insurance premiums, out-of-pocket health spending, and taxes devoted to health care (not adjusted for inflation).16 Ongoing research into measures of poverty has found that health care costs are a significant expenditure for families and individuals.		

What percentage of their income do American households pay in taxes compared to their local hospital expenses?		
Households in the middle fifth of the income spectrum paid an average of 11.5 percent of their income in overall federal taxes in 2010, the latest year for which data are available, according to CBO.[7]		

What percentage of American families pay more in payroll taxes than in federal income taxes?		
All but the top-earning 20% of American families pay more in payroll taxes than in federal income taxes, according to a Treasury Department analysis.		

What percentage of the median household income in 2018 did the average family pay for hospital spending?		
According to the Census, the average American household consisted of about 2.5 people, which means that the average family’s share of U.S. hospital spending in 2018 was about $9,200: nearly 15 percent of the median household income of $62,454.		

How much of the average American family's income goes towards paying taxes?		
The actual share of their income paid in taxes, according to the IRS, is 16.6 percent. Adding payroll taxes barely nudges that number.		

Do uninsured families in the United States pay a larger portion of their income towards healthcare costs compared to insured families?		
Uninsured families pay for a higher proportion of their total health care costs out of pocket than do insured families, however, and are more likely to have high medical expenses relative to income (IOM, 2002b).1		

How does the amount of taxes paid to local hospitals compare to the amount of federal taxes paid by middle-income households in America?		
- Overall federal taxes: Overall federal taxes — which include income, payroll, and excise taxes, and imputed corporate taxes — on middle-income households in 2009 were at their lowest levels in decades, according to the latest data from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).		

How much of their income do low-income families pay in property and sales taxes compared to income taxes?		
On average, low-income families receive a slight rebate through state and local income tax laws, amounting to 0.2 percent of their incomes, which helps to offset the comparatively high property and sales taxes they pay.

Some people have mistakenly claimed that OSHA standards (e.g., the Respiratory Protection standard, 29 CFR 1910.134; the Permit-Required Confined Space standard 29 CFR 1910.146; and the Air Contaminants standard, 29 CFR 1910.1000) apply to the issue of oxygen or carbon dioxide levels resulting from the use of medical masks or cloth face coverings in work settings with normal ambient air (e.g. healthcare settings, offices, retail settings, construction).		

Do masks comply with the US Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s 19.5% minimum oxygen level respiratory protection standard?		
Depending on the type of face mask used, and whether it is mandated by the employer or merely permitted for voluntary use, there are certain requirements that employers must follow under OSHA’s respiratory protection standard, 29 C.F.R. 1910.134, and perhaps other regulations.		

What are the requirements that employers must follow when providing face masks to employees under the US Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration's respiratory protection standard?

Do respirators used in accordance with OSHA's Respiratory Protection standard meet the 19.5% minimum oxygen level requirement?		
When respirators are used they “must be provided and used in accordance with OSHA’s Respiratory Protection standard” which is contained at 29 CFR 1910.134.		

Do surgical masks meet the US Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s 19.5% minimum oxygen level respiratory protection standard?		
Additionally, surgical masks are not respirators and therefore, are not NIOSH-certified and do not satisfy OSHA requirements for respiratory protection”(1999).		

What is the minimum oxygen level that the US Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration considers acceptable?		
Of interest was that although the minimum acceptable oxygen levels ranged from 19 to 20 percent (the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Respiratory Protection Standard, 29 CFR 1910.134, defines an oxygen-deficient atmosphere as one with an oxygen content below 19.5 percent), the acceptable maximum concentration of carbon monoxide ranged from 9 ppm to 50 ppm.		

Does the US Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration require the use of masks on a construction site?		
But OSHA does not require their use on a construction site. As OSHA’s guidance reminds, when a respiratory hazard exists, employers must comply with OSHA’s Respiratory Protection standard (29 C.F.R. Section 1910.134).		

Does the US Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration's 19.5% minimum oxygen level respiratory protection standard apply to the use of masks in the workplace?

458,Alex Jones claimed on the InfoWars website that Covid-19 is only killing older people.,"Did Alex Jones' claim that COVID-19 is only killing older people align with the World Health Organization's findings on the risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness and death?		
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic (2). Data from China have indicated that older adults, particularly those with serious underlying health conditions, are at higher risk for severe COVID-19–associated illness and death than are younger persons (3).		

What percentage of deaths due to COVID-19 were recorded in the age group 85 years and over?		
Of those age groups with deaths due to COVID-19 recorded, those aged 85 years and over had the smallest percentage of deaths due to COVID-19, at 6% of all deaths in this age group.		

Is it true that COVID-19 is only killing older people, as claimed by Alex Jones on the InfoWars website?		
In addition, the report from the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 Mortality, which presents data on 2114 COVID-19 related deaths among 55 924 laboratory-confirmed cases in China, reported a fatality rate among patients aged 80 years or older that was similar to the rate in the Italian sample (21.9% in China vs 20.2% in Italy).5		

What age group is disproportionately affected by COVID-19 deaths, according to the data?		
Breaking the deaths down further by age and sex, we see that deaths involving COVID-19 are more numerous for males and in people aged 65 years and older compared with those aged under 65 years, for all ethnic groups (Table 3).		

Does COVID-19 disproportionately affect older people, which could explain why some countries have a higher case-fatality rate?		
COVID-19 is more lethal in older patients, so the older age distribution in Italy may explain, in part, Italy’s higher case-fatality rate compared with that of other countries.		

What age group appears to have milder COVID-19 illness, according to the evidence provided?		
In contrast, persons aged ≤19 years appear to have milder COVID-19 illness, with almost no hospitalizations or deaths reported to date in the United States in this age group.		

What age groups are most at risk of dying from Covid-19?		
Based on these data, the mortality rates (number of deaths/number of cases), or the probability of dying if infected by the virus, were determined to be 3.6% for individuals aged 60-69, 8% for individuals aged 70-79, and 14.8% for patients aged 80 years or older.		

What percentage of COVID-19 deaths in the Netherlands, Italy, and New York City were people under 65 years old with no underlying health conditions?		
People <65 years old and not having any underlying predisposing conditions accounted for only 0.3%, 0.7%, and 1.8% of all COVID-19 deaths in Netherlands, Italy, and New York City.		

Does the data suggest that COVID-19 poses a higher risk to older age groups?		
In contrast, no ICU admissions or deaths were reported among persons aged ≤19 years. Similar to reports from other countries, this finding suggests that the risk for serious disease and death from COVID-19 is higher in older age groups.		

Does Alex Jones' claim that COVID-19 is only killing older people align with the evidence that a significant proportion of COVID-19 deaths occur in non-elderly people without underlying diseases?		
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the relative risk of COVID-19 death in people <65 years old versus older individuals in the general population, to provide estimates of absolute risk of COVID-19 death at the population level, and to understand what proportion of COVID-19 deaths occur in non-elderly people without underlying diseases in epicenters of the pandemic.

Hospitals and doctors do get paid more for Medicare patients diagnosed with COVID-19 or if it's considered presumed they have COVID-19 absent a laboratory-confirmed test, and three times more if the patients are placed on a ventilator to cover the cost of care and loss of business resulting from a shift in focus to treat COVID-19 cases.		

Did Alex Jones provide any evidence to support his claim that hospitals knowingly misdiagnosed patients during the pandemic in order to receive the $52,000 payment for each Covid-19 patient?		
- Add-on payment for inpatient hospital COVID-19 patients. Hospitals will receive a payment increase of 20 percent for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and later discharged during the emergency period.		

Did Alex Jones claim that hospitals received a specific amount of money for each COVID-19 patient and that they knowingly misdiagnosed patients during the pandemic?		
In mid-April 2020, social media users shared a meme implying that hospitals had a financial incentive to inflate the number of COVID-19 patients they were admitting in the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.		

How much extra money does the government pay to hospitals for treating COVID-19 patients?		
It is true, however, that the government will pay more to hospitals for COVID-19 cases in two senses: By paying an additional 20% on top of traditional Medicare rates for COVID-19 patients during the public health emergency, and by reimbursing hospitals for treating the uninsured patients with the disease (at that enhanced Medicare rate).

Cloth masks stopped just 3% of particles, while medical masks stopped 56%. A 2013 study (PDF) by Cambridge University, which studied how aerosolized bacteria and viruses passed through DIY mask materials inserted into a testing device, indicates that only vacuum cleaner bags came close to matching surgical masks’ ability to block one type of virus; among cloth masks, tea towels blocked the highest percentage of the virus.		

Do cloth masks filter particles effectively?		
Cloth face coverings are not as effective at blocking particles compared to surgical masks and N95 respirators, but they can reduce the spread of COVID-19, especially if used widely.		

What is the filtration efficiency of a tightly woven cotton cloth mask with two layers of chiffon?		
Based on the findings of a study to assess the filtration efficiencies of various types of commonly available fabrics for cloth face mask suggest that a cloth mask made of a tightly woven cotton fabric with two sheets of chiffon (made from polyester and spandex) seemed to be effective in filtering out 80-99% of the particles, depending on their size.		

What percentage of small particles do cloth masks filter, according to various studies?		
Attempts to measure the effectiveness of cloth masks to filter small particles show a wide range of results: cotton T-shirt (seven percent), shop towel (19 percent), coffee filter (49 percent).		

Can homemade cloth masks made with multiple layers and material combinations be effective at protecting the wearer from airborne pathogens if worn correctly?		
FDA warns that cloth masks are not protective and should not be relied upon to keep you safe when in public or close proximity to others; however, recent study results (see Konda et al and Ma et al) indicate that homemade cloth masks made with multiple layers and material combinations may be effective at protecting the mask wearer if worn correctly (no gaps between skin and the mask).		

How effective are cloth masks in filtering out particles compared to surgical masks?		
So how good is a good cloth mask? The best homemade cloth masks actually achieved better filtration (79 percent) than surgical masks (62 percent to 65 percent) in a peer-reviewed study at the Wake Forest Institute of Regenerative Medicine published in April.		

How effective are cloth masks in filtering particles compared to standard N95 masks?		
Standard N95 mask performance was used as a control to compare the results with cloth masks, and our results suggest that cloth masks are only marginally beneficial in protecting individuals from particles<2.5 μm.		

What is the filter efficiency of cloth or homemade masks?		
These studies demonstrate that cloth or homemade masks will have very low filter efficiency (2% to 38%).

What would happen to Indian traders if Indian consumers boycott Chinese products?		
Knee jerk reactions like the call to boycott Chinese products is not a solution to India’s reliance on imported goods and will harm Indian traders more than the Chinese as goods that are being boycotted by the Indian consumer has already been paid for by the Indian traders.		

What kind of goods are typically associated with the 'Made in China' label in India?

Is there evidence that China is concerned about the Indian calls for a boycott of Chinese goods?		
There is a sense that China is concerned about the Indian calls for a boycott. A piece in the Global Times, the newspaper which is a mouthpiece for the Communist party, called for India to curb “illogical boycott-China voices” after the border clash, adding: “It is unrealistic and self-destructive for Asia’s third-largest economy to launch frictions with the largest economy in the region.”		

Is the Indian government planning to restrict Chinese investment in the country?		
The boycott, adding to the Indian government's regulatory toughening on foreign investment, notably Chinese investment in the country, would dampen Chinese firms' interest in investing in the local market, inevitably pulverizing India's push for its manufacturing, Liu Xiaodong, chief representative of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), told the Global Times on Friday.		

Has there been a stronger anti-China sentiment in India in recent years?		
While India has similar boycott Chinese product campaigns every time disputes erupt in the last three years, experts said this time, the anti-China sentiment is stronger given that the country is being hit hard by the epidemic, and 20 Indian soldiers reportedly died in the clash.

487,Police departments in Germany were defunded and eliminated by the Nazis under Hermann Goering.,"Did the Nazi regime expand or reduce the power of police departments in Germany?		
The claim that Nazi Germany defunded local police departments is false, historians say. In fact, Hitler’s regime relied on a brutally carceral system with significantly expanded police power in the early 1930s through the end of World War II in 1945.		

Did the Nazis increase funding for the police in Germany?		
THE FACTS: Nazi leader Adolf Hitler did not defund the police. In fact, the opposite is true. “Let’s just say the Nazis did everything BUT defund the police,” said Gavriel D. Rosenfeld, a historian and history professor at Fairfield University, noting that Nazis made the police one of the chief recipients of state financial support aside from military spending.		

What changes did the Nazis make to the police force in Germany under the leadership of Heinrich Himmler and Kurt Daluege?		
In the prewar period, Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, and Kurt Daluege, chief of the Order Police, cooperated in transforming the police force of the Weimar Republic into militarised formations ready to serve the regime's aims of conquest and racial annihilation.		

What changes did Hermann Göring make to the Prussian police after the Nazis seized power in 1933?		
The Gestapo was formally organized after the Nazis seized power in 1933. Hermann Göring, the Prussian minister of the interior, detached the espionage and political units of the Prussian police and proceeded to staff them with thousands of Nazis.		

Did the Nazi regime create a national police force in Germany?		
The 1919 constitution of the Weimar Republic did provide for the possibility of creating a national police force, should the necessity arise, but it was only in the Nazi era that Gestapo (Secret State Police) were unified under central control and a national police force created (the Reich Security Main Office—Reichssicherheitshauptamt, or RSHA).		

What happened to the police departments in Germany under the leadership of Hermann Goering and the Nazi regime?		
Beginning in 1933 there was a gradual but thorough amalgamation of the police and SS. In 1936 Himmler, the Reichsführer SS, became Chief of the German Police with authority over the regular uniformed police as well as the Security Police.		

Did Hermann Goering eliminate or defund the police departments in Germany?		
In 1933, with Hitler and the Nazi Party in power, Göring was appointed as Minister of the Interior for Prussia,[8] for which he established a Prussian police force called the Geheime Staatspolizei, or Gestapo.[9]		

What happened to the police departments in Germany under the leadership of Hermann Goering and Heinrich Himmler?		
In addition, SS chief Heinrich Himmler also gained control over the regular (nonparty) police. Under Himmler and his deputy, Reinhard Heydrich, the SS centralized the German political police forces within a new agency, the Gestapo (Geheime Staatspolizei; Secret State Police).		

What happened to the control of police departments in Germany under Hermann Goering?		
In practice, since the SS answered only to Hitler, the de facto merger of the SS and the police made the police independent of Frick's control.[54][64] In September 1939, the security and police agencies, including the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo; security police) and SD (but not the Orpo), were consolidated into the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA), headed by Heydrich.[65]		

What changes were made to the police forces in Germany under the leadership of Hermann Goering?		
Ultimately, in 1936, all police forces, including traditional police, the SS, Gestapo — which became a national secret police force — and the SD, were centralized under Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS and chief of all German police.

There's no evidence that COVID-19 directly causes pleurisy, despite having similar symptoms. COVID-19 causes conditions that can lead to pleurisy, such as respiratory infections and pneumonia.		

Can a lung infection (pleurisy) caused by a viral or bacterial infection be contagious?		
This depends on the cause. Although pleurisy itself isn't contagious, some of the causes of pleurisy, like viral and bacterial infections, are contagious.		

Did the claim that a grocery store worker got a lung infection from ""breathing in her own bacteria"" while wearing a mask for hours contradict the current guidelines on mask use during the COVID-19 pandemic?		
Until further evidence is available, current guidelines recommend wearing a surgical mask when caring for patients who have respiratory infections with droplet transmission and a respirator for those with airborne transmission, except for the emerging infection of COVID-19 in which guidelines regarding mask use are still evolving.		

How can a person contract a lung infection like pneumonia by breathing in their own bacteria?		
Pneumonia is a common lung infection caused by bacteria, a virus or fungi. It is often spread via coughing, sneezing, or even breathing, and those who don't exhibit symptoms can also spread the illness.		

Can wearing a mask for extended periods increase the risk of a lung infection?		
There is some evidence that wearing a mask can be outcome-determinative. In 2008, one review of controlled studies of SARS demonstrated that masks were protective[5] alone and were more protective when part of a regimen of hand-washing, and wearing gloves and gowns, a finding more relevant to healthcare situations than public ones.		

What medical condition can cause pleurisy?		
In some cases, you can prevent pleurisy by preventing the medical condition that causes it. For example, some types of pneumonia can be prevented by vaccination.		

What are some possible causes of pleurisy?		
Pleurisy can be caused by a variety of conditions, including viral or bacterial infections, autoimmune disorders, and pulmonary embolism.		

What are some ways to reduce the risk of developing pleurisy?		
The good news? In most cases, pleurisy leads to no long-term problems. Additionally, while pleurisy prevention depends on its causes, there are some ways to reduce your aging loved one’s risk of developing pleurisy, including maintaining a healthy lifestyle, keeping conditions known to cause pleurisy under control, regular vaccinations for pneumonia and the flu, and smoking cessation.

532,Asymptomatic patients need no isolation ... A complete U-turn by WHO. After destroying the economy of the world now a complete U-turn,"Does the WHO believe that asymptomatic patients are less likely to transmit the virus?		
In addition to the studies about asymptomatic transmission that Van Kerkhove referred to, the WHO has also received data from member countries that “suggests that asymptomatically-infected individuals are much less likely to transmit the virus than those who develop symptoms,” according to WHO’s interim guidance on masks issued last week.		

Does the WHO still believe that asymptomatic patients can transmit COVID-19?		
WHO has maintained that asymptomatic people can transmit COVID-19 but more research is required to determine the extent of the transmission.		

Does the CDC suggest that asymptomatic patients may be a significant factor in the spread of COVID-19?		
""If the COVID-19 pandemic is found to be driven by undetected asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, new innovations in disease detection and prevention (beyond exhaustive contact tracing, mass testing, and isolation of asymptomatic contacts) may be needed,"" the CDC said in its May 4 article.		

Does the World Health Organization (WHO) consider asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals as a problem for controlling disease?		
According to Dr. Jha, the WHO may be making a distinction between asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic people, but both are a ""huge problem for controlling disease.""		

Does the CDC's research suggest that asymptomatic patients may have contributed to the spread of SARS-CoV-2?		
This suggests that ""transmission from asymptomatic and presymptomatic residents, who were not recognized as having SARS-CoV-2 infection and therefore not isolated, might have contributed to further spread,"" according to research published in the CDC's April 3 ""Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.""		

Did the World Health Organization (WHO) initially recommend isolating asymptomatic patients with COVID-19?		
The clinical presentation of COVID-19 can include minimal or no symptoms (WHO, 2020a). Asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission is clearly reported and is estimated to account for around half of all cases of COVID-19 (He et al., 2020).		

Has the World Health Organization changed its stance on the spread of COVID-19 from asymptomatic patients?		
A top official with the World Health Organization has walked back statements that the spread of COVID-19 from people who do not show symptoms is ""very rare,"" amid backlash from experts who have questioned the claim due to a lack of data.		

Does the World Health Organization recommend isolation for patients with symptoms of COVID-19?		
Accordingly, most recommendations by WHO on personal protective measures (such as use of masks and physical distancing) are based on controlling transmission from symptomatic patients, including patients with mild symptoms who are not easy to identify early on.		

Does the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend isolation for asymptomatic patients?		
The Harvard Global Health Institute issued a statement over email saying that the WHO “created confusion,” and that “[a]ll of the best evidence suggests that people without symptoms can and do readily spread SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes COVID-19.”

Therefore, identifying and isolating patients with asymptomatic COVID-19 as early as possible is critical to control the transmission of COVID-19.

Social media posts claim the Hells Angels and another motorcycle gang joined forces to remove anti-fascist movement Antifa from Seattle, where protesters established a police-free autonomous zone after protests prompted by the death of George Floyd.		

Are there any credible reports of Antifa members roaming the streets of Seattle?		
But claims that bands of militant Antifa members are roving the Seattle streets appear to be grossly exaggerated in right-wing media.		

What is the nature of the groups that are uniting to drive Antifa out of Seattle?		
Antifa is a hard-to-define, loosely affiliated network of groups that have a history of using violence during counter protests of demonstrations put on by right-wing groups across the country.		

Have Antifa groups been involved in protests and rallies in Seattle in recent years?		
Antifa groups have been increasingly active in protests and rallies over the past few years, especially ones that include far-right participants.

The DHS report said there was some evidence based on open-source and DHS reporting that Antifa may be contributing to the violence, a view shared by some local police departments in public statements and interviews with Reuters.		

What is the proposed classification of Antifa by the authors of the statement?		
Following recent calls to declare Antifa, a loosely-organized collective of anti-fascists, a domestic terrorist organization, we argue for the categorization of the group as a street gang instead.		

What themes were presented in the media about Antifa in Seattle?		
These themes included labeling Antifa as a terrorist organization, trying to link Antifa to George Soros, presenting Antifa as the aggressor and far-right extremists as the victims, and trying to portray Antifa as the “real” fascists.		

Are the biker gangs involved in the effort to drive Antifa out of Seattle primarily motivated by a desire to uphold the law or by their own interests and culture?		
But experts say its members are increasingly becoming entangled in violence with other biker groups, blurring the line between professionals who are sworn to uphold the law and a biker culture with a long history of criminal activity.		

Are Antifa groups planning to counter-protest in Seattle?		
Antifa groups are set to counter-protest in a number of cities, increasing the potential for violence, but civil rights groups and other local activists also have planned a number of positive events to counter ACT’s hate.

Trump said Christians thought his Bible photo op was “beautiful.” He leaves out that many Christians condemned the photo op and said he used the church and holy book as a prop.		

What did Trump say about the Bible photo op at St. John's Episcopal Church?

Did the phrase ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" originate from a source other than President Donald Trump?		
The quote ""When the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" has a dark history.

George Wallace using the phrase).		

Did President Donald Trump attribute the phrase ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" to someone else?		
The quote the president tweeted — ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" — was said by former Miami Police Chief Walter Headley during a December 1967 news conference, according to The Washington Post.		

What was the original meaning of the phrase ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" when it was used by a Miami police chief in the 1960s?		
- Trump wrote: “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” a phrase used by a Miami police chief in the 1960s and widely interpreted as a violent threat against protesters.

Did President Donald Trump claim that the phrase ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" has two meanings?		
""When the looting starts, the shooting starts"" was part of a phrase perhaps most famously used by Miami Police Chief Walter Headley in a 1967 speech outlining his department's efforts to ""combat young hoodlums who have taken advantage of the civil rights campaign.""		

Did President Donald Trump claim that the phrase ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" has two meanings?

585,Wastewater can be an early indicator for a coronavirus outbreak.,"How can wastewater be used in tracking the spread of COVID-19?		
Monitoring municipal wastewater and sludge for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease COVID-19, along with clinical data on infections and virus shedding rates can provide valuable information to inform COVID-19 epidemiology and the State’s and local health officials’ response to the current COVID-19 pandemic.		

How long before a COVID-19 outbreak is detected in clinical samples can SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern be identified in wastewater samples?		
Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) variants of concern can be identified in wastewater samples 1-2 weeks prior to being detected in clinical samples from the same area, making wastewater surveillance useful for detecting and monitoring SARS-CoV-2 at the population scale.		

Can the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater indicate the presence of COVID-19 in a community?		
This is the first report of detection of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage. The detection of the virus in sewage, even when the COVID-19 prevalence is low, indicates that sewage surveillance could be a sensitive tool to monitor the circulation of the virus in the population.		

Can wastewater be used as a tool for detecting and warning of a potential coronavirus outbreak?		
Experts say wastewater detection of SARS-CoV-2 could act not only as a supplement to medical testing but as an early warning system.		

Is there sufficient evidence to support the use of wastewater as a reliable indicator for a coronavirus outbreak?		
However, the paper also highlights several challenges for wastewater monitoring. “Although multiple efforts are underway to develop environmental surveillance programs for SARS-CoV-2, there are gaps in our knowledge and further research is needed before we can reliably use wastewater to monitor COVID-19 outbreaks,” says Kitajima.		

Is wastewater analysis a reliable method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks?		
This validates wastewater RT-qPCR analysis as a sensitive and reliable technique for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.		

Can wastewater be used to detect the presence of COVID-19 before symptoms appear in infected individuals?		
With an infectious disease like COVID-19, people may be contagious before they show any symptoms. Preliminary research from across the country and around the world indicates that monitoring wastewater for the presence of the genetic marker of SARS-CoV-2, its RNA, may be useful as a sensitive early indicator of low levels of infections in the community.		

Can wastewater be used to detect the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?		
- Periodically collecting wastewater samples from sewer networks for the trace of the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be effective as a primary non-clinical warning tool for early detection.		

Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be detected in wastewater?		
However, given that SARS-CoV-2 is routinely shed in faeces and other secretions that can end up in wastewater (Han et al. 2020; Pan et al. 2020; Zheng et al. 2020), and noting the proven value of historical environmental virus surveillance, the work is expected to provide a valuable information source to help inform COVID-19 control strategies.		

Does the concentration of COVID-19 virus in sewage correlate with the reported prevalence of the disease in the population?		
The detection of the virus RNA in sewage, even when the COVID-19 prevalence is low, and the correlation between concentration in sewage and reported prevalence of COVID-19, indicate that sewage surveillance could be a sensitive tool to monitor the circulation of the virus in the population.

593,UV Rays from sunlight kill Corona virus.,"Does UV radiation from sunlight have an antiviral effect on the SARS-CoV-2 virus?		
Ultraviolet radiation (UV) has a well-known antiviral effect, but measurements on the radiation dose necessary to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 have not been published so far.		

Can sunlight inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus?		
Exposure to ambient solar UV radiation inactivates SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. An action spectrum describing the wavelength dependence of the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by UV and visible radiation has recently been published.		

Is there any evidence that UV Rays from sunlight are effective against the Covid-19 virus?		
While UV light has been proven effective against SARS and MERS, as well as other kinds of coronaviruses, Jones said there have been limited studies looking at how it interacts with the Covid-19 virus.		

Can UV rays from sunlight effectively eliminate the novel coronavirus?		
Thus, in theory, UV light would be able to destroy the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov). The virus is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat, so ultraviolet radiation can effectively eliminate the virus.		

Does UV light have an effect on the inactivation of coronaviruses?		
(The devices we've tested use 254 nm light.) With respect to SARS-CoV-2 in particular, experts expect its response will be similar to that of other coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, which have been shown to be inactivated by UV light.		

Can UV light effectively inactivate coronaviruses?		
UV light treatment can be employed to target three transmission forms of viral particles: (1) in droplets, (2) aerosolized, and (3) on fomites; however, the inactivation of coronaviruses via UV light can be challenging as inactivation rates vary based on wavelength and the length of the RNA transcript (Stern and Sefton, 1982).		

Does the evidence suggest that UV rays from sunlight can kill the coronavirus?		
While practical, large-scale efficacy against the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has yet to be shown, UV light shows a lot of promise: Seoul Semiconductor in early April reported a “99.9% sterilization of coronavirus (COVID-19) in 30 seconds” with their UV LED products.		

What is the effect of UV light on aerosolized viral particles, such as the SARS-CoV-1?		
Other studies have examined the effectiveness of UV light on aerosolized viral particles. SARS-CoV-1 in an aerosolized form treated with UV light illustrated a greater susceptibility (Z-value ratio of air to liquid of 85.7) compared to that of the virus in liquid media (Walker and Ko, 2007).		

Can UV rays from sunlight prevent the replication of the coronavirus?		
Studies have shown that ultraviolet light can be used against other coronaviruses such as SARS, as the radiation prevents the viral particles from replicating themselves.

Rumours linking 5G to COVID-19 have been making the rounds on social media for several months, associating the deployment of 5G in China with the emergence of COVID-19.		

Is there any evidence that the rollout of 5G technology is linked to the COVID-19 pandemic?		
The claim circulated online as conspiracists promoted a theory that COVID-19 is linked to the development of 5G, the fifth generation of wireless communications technologies, which has been rolled out around the world since 2019.		

Was the rollout of 5G networks in 2019 coincidental with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic?		
5G networks began rolling out in cities and countries in 2018, but were more widely adopted in 2019 – the same year that Wuhan, China, saw the world’s first coronavirus outbreak.		

Did other cities with 5G trials experience similar outbreaks of COVID-19?		
The link between 5G and the novel coronavirus began to appear sometime in mid-January, when people began to connect Wuhan as the original source of the outbreak and an early testing site for 5G. (Rahman notes that other big cities had similar trials without similar outbreaks, while Iran, which also had an early outbreak of COVID-19, doesn’t have 5G networks at all.)

1) In laboratory testing, Signify’s UV-C light sources reduced SARS-CoV-2 virus infectivity on a surface to below detectable levels in as few as 9 seconds (Nadia Storm et al, Rapid and complete inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by ultraviolet-C irradiation, 2020.		

Is there sufficient evidence to suggest that UV-C light can effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-2?		
Existing literature indicates that Far UV-C can be effective in inactivating SARS-CoV-2 and other airborne pathogens (e.g., those that cause influenza and the common cold), given sufficient UV exposure.		

Can UV light effectively kill the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)?		
However, we do know UV light can be effective against coronaviruses. Our own Violet UV-C machineis proven to kill 99.99% of human coronavirus (although it’s important to note it’s not yet tested against the actual COVID-19 strain, SARS-CoV-2, because that strain is not yet available for commercial disinfectant testing).A study published in the American Journal of Infection Controlshowed that introducing the Violet UV-C device in a paediatric care facility reduced the rate of viral infections.		

Can ultraviolet light effectively inactivate the SARS-CoV2 virus?		
UV light treatment can be employed to target three transmission forms of viral particles: (1) in droplets, (2) aerosolized, and (3) on fomites; however, the inactivation of coronaviruses via UV light can be challenging as inactivation rates vary based on wavelength and the length of the RNA transcript (Stern and Sefton, 1982).		

Has Seoul Semiconductor demonstrated the effectiveness of their UV LED products in killing the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)?		
As a technology, ultraviolet light disinfection has been around for a while. And while practical, large-scale efficacy against the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be shown, UV light shows a lot of promise: SSLEEC member company Seoul Semiconductor in early April reported a “99.9% sterilization of coronavirus (COVID-19) in 30 seconds” with their UV LED products.		

How does UV light affect the coronavirus in an aerosolized form?		
Other studies have examined the effectiveness of UV light on aerosolized viral particles. SARS-CoV-1 in an aerosolized form treated with UV light illustrated a greater susceptibility (Z-value ratio of air to liquid of 85.7) compared to that of the virus in liquid media (Walker and Ko, 2007).		

How does the ultraviolet light used in the devices tested compare to the ultraviolet light that is expected to inactivate SARS-CoV-2?		
(The devices we've tested use 254 nm light.) With respect to SARS-CoV-2 in particular, experts expect its response will be similar to that of other coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, which have been shown to be inactivated by UV light.		

Can ultraviolet light be used to kill the coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) without posing a risk to human health?		
The use of ultraviolet (UV) light for inactivating bacteria and viruses is well established (1, 2). However, UV radiations emitted by typical germicidal lamps with a peak emission at 254 nm represent a human health hazard, causing skin cancer (3, 4) and cataracts (5, 6).

626,A new executive order put in place by President Donald Trump to target social media companies is in violation of the First Amendment and free speech protections.,"Does the new executive order by President Donald Trump aim to remove legal protections for social media companies?		
Trump’s executive order, a draft of which was published online, would accuse the social media platforms of “selective censoring” and attempt to remove legal protections for those companies under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.		

What is the basis for the challenge to President Donald Trump's executive order targeting social media companies?		
President Donald Trump’s order targeting social media companies was challenged in court by a nonprofit group that claims the edict violates free-speech protections guaranteed by the First Amendment.		

Does the First Amendment protect social media companies from government regulation of their content moderation practices?		
- The First Amendment applies to government action regarding speech and not to the content moderation of private entities such as social media platforms, and ironically government regulation of social media could itself be a First Amendment violation.		

Does the executive order attempt to restrict speech based on its content?		
The American Civil Liberties Union warns that the order represents a direct threat to platforms that they will be punished if they engage in speech that displeases the president, and correctly points out that the president “has it backwards: the First Amendment protects us from the government, not the government from us”.		

Does the executive order attempt to limit the liability protections of social media companies under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act?

Does the executive order target social media companies for their content moderation practices rather than their hosting of content?		
In addition to misreading the act’s protection against liability for content hosted by internet intermediaries, like social media companies, the executive order would prohibit federal spending, marketing, or advertising on platforms the government deems to “restrict free speech” and directs regulators and prosecutors to examine the practices of sites like Twitter and Facebook to judge whether they are deceptive or unfair.		

Does the US executive order target social media companies in a way that could potentially infringe on their First Amendment rights?		
The executive order tests the boundaries of the White House's authority. In a long-shot legal bid, it seeks to curtail the power of large social media platforms by reinterpreting a critical 1996 law that shields websites and tech companies from lawsuits.		

What potential implications could the executive order have for free speech protections beyond social media regulation?		
While the executive order may only concern the regulation of social media platforms, it could set a dangerous precedent if upheld that could allow future government intervention into other speech rights.

670,Organic foods are more nutritious than conventional foods.,"Do organic crops contain higher levels of antioxidants compared to conventional crops?		
There are nutritional benefits to certain organic foods as well. A 2014 analysis of multiple studies by the British Journal of Nutrition, for instance, concluded that organic crops contained higher antioxidant levels than their non-organic counterparts.		

Do organic and conventional foods have significantly different nutrient contents?		
However, some indicated that differences in nutrient content between organic and conventional foods vary considerably and depend on both the type of nutrient and food under examination.(17,19) More recently, the systematic review of Smith-Spangler et al.(25) concluded that with the exception of phosphorus, differences in nutrient content between organic and conventional foods vary considerably.		

Do studies show that organic foods have a higher nutritional value compared to conventional foods?		
Further supporting the claim that organic foods in general are more nutritious is a report by Virginia Worthington, M.S., Sc.D., C.N.S. Reviewing 41 published studies comparing the nutritional value of organically grown and conventionally grown fruits, vegetables, and grains, Worthington concluded there were significantly more of several nutrients in organic crops.		

What are the key differences in nutritional value between organic and conventional foods?		
A new analysis appears to refuel the debate about the nutritional value of organic versus conventional foods, by finding that organic crops and crop-based foods contain up to 69% more of certain antioxidants, are four times less likely to contain pesticide residue, and have significantly lower levels of the toxic heavy metal cadmium.		

Do organic crops contain more essential minerals, phytonutrients, and vitamin C compared to conventional crops?		
There is mounting evidence that organically grown foods generate more nutrients and fewer nitrates. In a review of 400 published papers comparing organic and nonorganic foods, Soil Association Certification Ltd. Of the United Kingdom reported that organic crops were higher in essential minerals, phytonutrients, and vitamin C. Phytonutrients are plant compounds other than vitamins and minerals (such as enzymes, antioxidants, bioflavonoids).

In Italy, the possibility of performing autopsies or post-mortem diagnostic studies on suspect, probable, or confirmed COVID-19 cases has been intensively debated (5, 6); however, post-mortem pathological analysis of COVID-19 patients in China has shown findings consistent with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) (7–9) (Figure 1).		

Did the WHO instruct countries to not conduct autopsies on COVID-19 patients?		
Interestingly, medical autopsies are not performed routinely in China. At the outset of the epidemic in China, the bodies of patients with COVID-19 were not autopsied, but later administrative authorization was obtained to perform autopsies on COVID-19 patients, with strict adherence to biosafety guidelines.		

Did Italy conduct an autopsy on a COVID-19 patient despite the WHO's advice?		
Autopsy has also been debated widely in relation to COVID-19 in India. The central government has advised against conducting autopsies of confirmed COVID-19 patients.		

What criteria did Italian researchers propose for justifying an autopsy on a COVID-19 patient?		
Italian researchers think that autopsy on a COVID-19 patient should be well-justified, but propose no criteria for such justification [12].		

Did Italy conduct an autopsy of a COVID-19 patient in the presence of a federal state sanitary and epidemiological surveillance representative?		
Medical and forensic autopsies of persons with COVID-19 must be performed in the presence of a federal state sanitary and epidemiological surveillance representative [43].		

Did the purpose of autopsies in Italy differ from the purpose of autopsies in Wuhan as described by the evidence?		
Although autopsies were performed on two patients in Wuhan who died of COVID-19, the purpose of the autopsy was not to identify the cause of the death, but rather to investigate the damage of the virus on the patients' tissues and organs, thereby exploring etiology and pathogenesis and on this basis develop better diagnosis and treatment plans.		

Did the evidence suggest that autopsies on COVID-19 patients posed a risk to medical and forensic pathologists in Italy?		
Although there are few reports of COVID-19 infection among dissection room staff unsupported by strong evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during autopsies [33], deaths of medical and forensic pathologists who performed autopsies on ""red zone"" patients suggest that such transmission is highly probable.		

Did Italy conduct an autopsy on a COVID-19 patient despite the Ministry of Healthcare's recommendation to avoid autopsies on COVID-19 corpses?		
In the spring of 2020, there was a surge in COVID-19 cases in Italy. On April 1, 2020 the Ministry of Healthcare of Italy issued a recommendation to avoid autopsies or postmortem diagnostic examinations on corpses infected COVID-19 [14].		

Did Italy conduct an autopsy on a COVID-19 patient before the WHO declared the COVID-19 pandemic on the 11th of March, 2020?		
The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 pandemic on the 11th of March, 2020. Previously, on the 14th of February, the first COVID-19 autopsy in Spain had been performed in the Hospital Arnau de Vilanova-Lliria, Valencia; however, the virological diagnosis had been made subsequent to the post-mortem examination1.		

Did Italy conduct autopsies on COVID-19 patients under specific circumstances?		
However, autopsies performed on COVID-19 patients whose cause of death is controversial or involves legal issues instead belong to forensic autopsy.

Testing for blood clotting abnormalities reveals which critically ill COVID-19 patients are at risk for thrombotic events and need hemodialysisJournal of the American College of Surgeons May 15, 2020		

Is there a correlation between COVID-19 and an increased risk of blood clotting?		
Blood clots appear to be associated with a higher risk of dying from COVID-19. Likewise, elevated markers of blood clotting are associated with an increased risk of admission to the intensive care unit and a worse prognosis overall.		

Do COVID-19 patients experience severe blood clotting that does not resolve on its own?		
However, in patients with COVID-19 the clotting appears to be particularly severe and—as evidenced by case studies in China and elsewhere1—clots in COVID-19 patients do not appear to dissipate, explained Dr. Wright.		

Does COVID-19 lead to an increase in blood clotting in patients?		
The findings suggest early testing for D-dimer, a protein fragment in the blood associated with increased blood clotting (thrombosis) in COVID-19 patients, could enable clinicians to prescribe specific treatments, including anticoagulants (“blood thinners”), at a much earlier stage, which might reduce the number of people subsequently having further strokes or blood clots elsewhere in the body.		

Do COVID-19 patients experience severe and persistent blood clotting?		
However, in patients with COVID-19 the clotting appears to be particularly severe and—as evidenced by case studies in China and elsewhere*—clots in COVID-19 patients do not appear to dissipate, explained Dr. Wright.		

What percentage of COVID-19 patients in an intensive care unit were found to have a venous thromboembolism (VTE)?		
Another study of 184 COVID-19 patients in an intensive care unit in the Netherlands found that 27% had a venous thromboembolism (VTE), a condition where a blood clot forms, usually in the deep veins of the leg, thigh, or pelvis.		

Is COVID-19 associated with an increased risk of blood clotting?		
However, many blood clots in COVID-19 are occurring despite the use of low-dose blood thinners. As such, it is a question of intense discussion whether people admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19 should receive a higher-than-usual dose of blood thinners to prevent blood clots and improve clinical outcomes.		

Does COVID-19 lead to excessive blood clot formation?		
High blood levels of coagulation factors can lead to excessive blood clot formation. Many investigators have noticed that the clotting issues seen with COVID-19 closely resemble a blood clotting disorder known as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

700,Voting by mail results in widespread fraud,"Does the evidence suggest that voting by mail leads to widespread fraud?		
Exhaustive analyses by experts, courts, and the government—compiled by the Brennan Center for Justice—confirm that voter fraud is virtually nonexistent, and a recently released study looking at data from 1996 through 2018 concluded that voting by mail has no discernible effect on party vote shares or the partisan share of the electorate.		

What is the rate of voter fraud in states that hold their elections primarily by mail?		
Despite this dramatic increase in mail voting over time, fraud rates remain infinitesimally small. None of the five states that hold their elections primarily by mail has had any voter fraud scandals since making that change.		

What is the rate of voter fraud in the United States, according to the 2017 study by the Brennan Center for Justice?		
Voter fraud does exist, but not on the massive scale that Trump claims. An expansive study in 2017 from the Brennan Center for Justice, a liberal-leaning think tank, found that the rate of voter fraud in the United States was somewhere between 0.00004% and 0.0009% of all votes.		

Does the claim that voting by mail results in widespread fraud align with the assessment of voting experts regarding the risks of mail balloting?		
Voting fraud in general is considered to be rare, although voting experts agree that the risks are greater for mail balloting than for in-person voting.		

Does the evidence suggest that voting by mail is associated with widespread fraud?		
“This is consistent with what Republican and Democratic election officials in states with high rates of mail voting have found—fraud is extremely rare in mail voting, as it is with in-person voting, and there are many security features on mail ballots (including signature matching and mail tracking, along with many others) that effectively prevent fraud and in those rare cases where it occurs, enables prosecution.”		

What is the relationship between voting by mail and the occurrence of voter fraud in the five states that conduct their elections primarily by mail?		
During this time, studies have repeatedly shown that voter fraud is exceptionally rare. Notably, none of the five states that conduct their elections primarily by mail have had any voter fraud scandals since making that change.		

Does mail voting have a higher rate of fraud compared to in-person voting?		
Numerous academic studies have shown that cases of voter fraud are extremely rare, although they do occur, and that fraud in mail voting seems to occur more often than with in-person voting.		

Does voting by mail result in widespread fraud?		
As the New York Times editorial board notes, “states that use vote-by-mail have encountered essentially zero fraud: Oregon, the pioneer in this area, has sent out more than 100 million mail-in ballots since 2000, and has documented only about a dozen cases of proven fraud.”		

Does the evidence suggest that voting by mail is associated with a higher rate of misconduct compared to in-person voting?		
Justin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Marymount University and voter fraud expert, told us that while he is not aware of any valid statistics on the prevalence of fraud in mail-in ballots, “I do collect anecdotal reports, and it is clear (and I think most observers from across the political spectrum agree) that misconduct in the mail voting process is meaningfully more prevalent than misconduct in the process of voting in person.”		

Does voting by mail result in widespread voter fraud?		
Facts First: Trump is lying about voter fraud. Multiple studies have confirmed that there is no widespread voter fraud in this country, and millions of Americans vote-by-mail each year without systemic problems.

718,Corona Virus is less likely to spread in a retail setting because people are moving around frequently and not just sitting or standing indoors for long periods of time during Worships.,"Does the movement of people in a retail setting reduce the likelihood of airborne transmission of the Corona Virus?		
Recent evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can spread via airborne transmission, particularly in indoor environments with poor ventilation [3, 4].		

Does the claim that Corona Virus is less likely to spread in a retail setting because people are moving around frequently and not just sitting or standing indoors for long periods of time during worship contradict the evidence that the virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings?		
The virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings, where people tend to spend longer periods of time.		

How does the movement of people in a retail setting affect the spread of Corona Virus?		
The importance of different routes of transmission for SARS-CoV-2 is an ongoing area of research. SARS-CoV-2 can remain airborne in indoor environments for hours, potentially increasing in concentration over time.		

How does the likelihood of airborne transmission of COVID-19 compare to close contact in a retail setting?		
The CDC also notes that COVID-19 can spread by airborne transmission, although this is less common than close contact with a person.		

Does the movement of people in a retail setting reduce the likelihood of airborne transmission of the Corona Virus?

What types of settings have been found to be linked to clusters of COVID-19 cases?		
In conclusion, we found evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in many types of settings. Our results provide a basis to identify possible places that are linked to clusters of cases and could be closely monitored, for example by linking to app-based contact tracing, and/or remain closed in the first instance following the progressive removal of lockdown restrictions.		

Does the movement of people in a retail setting reduce the likelihood of airborne transmission of the Corona Virus?		
Therefore, unless adequate precautions are taken, the longer a space is occupied and the more people that are present, the greater the potential for airborne transmission of the virus (See also Key References on Indoor Air and COVID-19).

What is the estimated number of people in the UK who have been infected with the new coronavirus according to a UK-Chinese medical research paper?		
A UK-Chinese medical research paper reports a statistical model finding that ""estimates suggest the actual number of infected cases could be much higher than the reported, with estimated 26,701 cases (as of 28 January 2020).""[278]		

What percentage of the UK population is estimated to have been infected with the new coronavirus as of early April 2020?		
Although more than 2.5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, studies suggest that (as of early April 2020) no more than 2-4%3–5 of any country’s population has been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus that causes COVID-19).		

What proportion of the population in England is estimated to have been infected with Covid-19?		
- Estimates from the UK’s Office for National Statistics (ONS) state that 1 in 25 people in England were infected with Covid-19 before Christmas.		

How many people in England have tested positive for COVID-19 according to Public Health England data?		
Some of the main studies identified include Public Health England data on the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases in England, which capture the cumulative number of people in England who have tested positive for COVID-19.		

Are the reported numbers of COVID-19 cases in the UK accurate representations of the total number of people who have been infected with the new coronavirus?		
However, the actual number of COVID-19 cases is not known. When media outlets claim to report the ‘number of cases’ they are not being precise and omit to say that it is the number of confirmed cases they speak about.		

Is it estimated that a large number of people in the UK have been infected with the new coronavirus, but not all of them have been detected or reported?		
Considering that a large number of cases are asymptomatic (or present with very mild symptoms) and that testing has not been performed on the entire population, only a fraction of the SARS-CoV-2 infected population is detected, confirmed through a laboratory test, and officially reported as a COVID-19 case.		

How many people in the UK have been infected with the new coronavirus?		
This study addresses an important clinical priority: finding out how many people across the UK have a COVID-19 infection at a given point in time, or at least test positive for it, either with or without symptoms; how many new cases have occurred in a given time period; and how many people are ever likely to have had the infection.		

What is the total number of COVID-19 cases in the UK between January-June 2020?		
COVID-19 cases per million population (total between January-June 2020): Although all countries in the sample have been exposed to the virus, the extent of infection differs greatly from country to country.		

Does the evidence support the claim that 19 million people in the UK have been infected with the new coronavirus?		
For now, we do not think the data support the claim that the number of infections in Santa Clara County was between 50 and 85 times the count of cases reported at the time, or the implied interval for the IFR of 0.12–0.2%.

722,Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden proposes raising the age to be eligible for Social Security benefits to 75.,"Is there a proposal to raise the age of eligibility for Social Security benefits, and if so, what is the proposed age?		
Some analysts have suggested raising Social Security's earliest eligibility age from 62 to 65. This reform is included with some of the reforms mentioned earlier to raise the normal retirement age.		

Does Joe Biden propose raising the age to be eligible for Social Security benefits?		
Increasing the retirement age for Social Security to age 68 by 2023 while increasing the early retirement age from 62 to 65 is not a step that The Heritage Foundation recommends lightly.		

What is the current earliest eligibility age for receiving Social Security retirement benefits?		
Individuals can first begin receiving Social Security retirement benefits at age 62. This earliest eligibility age (EEA) has remained fixed even as the age for receipt of full benefits—benefits without reduction for ""early retirement""—has increased from 65 to 66 and is scheduled to further increase to age 67.1 This policy brief is not intended to either advocate or oppose an increase in the EEA; rather, it is intended to point out the many design issues that policymakers would need to consider if they chose to develop proposals for increasing the EEA in the future.		

Does Joe Biden's proposal to raise revenues from high-earning individuals include raising the age to be eligible for Social Security benefits?		
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has proposed changes to Social Security policy that would increase benefits, especially for low earners, while raising more revenues from high-earning individuals.		

Does Joe Biden propose raising the age to be eligible for Social Security benefits to 75?		
Some people contend that policymakers should raise Medicare's eligibility age to 67 to match the scheduled increase in Social Security's ""full retirement age"" to 67.		

What specific age increase did Joe Biden consider for the full retirement age in his 2007 presidential campaign?		
According to NBC News, Biden's 2007 presidential campaign featured more of a centrist view on fixing Social Security, whereby increasing the earnings tax cap and raising the full retirement age would both be given serious consideration.		

What is the proposed change to the eligibility age for Social Security benefits under Joe Biden's plan?		
- Raising Social Security's early eligibility age to 64 or the full retirement age to 70 would, in the long term, boost the size of the workforce and the economy by slightly more than 1 percent.		

Does Joe Biden support raising the age to be eligible for Social Security benefits?		
Some policymakers, including prominent presidential candidates, have endorsed raising Social Security’s full retirement age to improve the program’s long-term solvency.		

How many times has Joe Biden proposed raising the age to be eligible for Social Security benefits?		
Biden, who became a senator in 1973, floated raising the Social Security retirement age in 1983.		

Has Joe Biden previously suggested raising the age to be eligible for Social Security benefits, or has he proposed cutting or freezing Social Security benefits in the past?		
The campaign pointed to instances throughout Biden’s career in which the former vice president suggested cutting or freezing Social Security benefits including a 1995 vote for an amendment to the balanced budget bill which would have frozen Social Security expansions.

It has been difficult to track reliable testing data in the United States for a number of reasons. Data from the Centers for Disease Control, which lags several days, reports the number of specimens tested, not the number of people — multiple specimens can be tested from each person.		

Which countries rank among the top in the world for coronavirus testing per capita?		
As of March 15, Germany was behind only the UAE, South Korea and Australia as the country to have administered the most tests in the world per capita, at an estimated 2,023 per million people.		

Did the United States have a comparable coronavirus testing capacity to South Korea at the time of the first reported cases?

""The Democrats are pushing for an implanted microchip in humans, and everyone to be vaccinated."" says a Facebook post with text on a plain background.		

Are there any proposals or legislation from the Democratic party to implant microchips in humans as part of a vaccination program?		
We found no evidence of proposals or legislation, Democratic or otherwise, to promote implanting microchips to counter the coronavirus.		

Are Democrats advocating for the mandatory implantation of microchips in humans and vaccination of everyone?		
In addition, those pushing microchip implants are not providing accurate product information. As a result, important decisions are being made based on incomplete, misleading, and false data.

As for mandatory vaccinations, the idea that Democrats are pushing for this power is exaggerated, because the Supreme Court long ago decided that the government has that power.

On microchips, there’s no evidence that implanted microchips are being contemplated in a serious way to fight the coronavirus.

The idea of inserting GPS microchips below people’s skin is not completely novel.

Joe Biden has joined the cause of voting by mail, making an aggressive pitch for federally funded absentee ballots for everyone this year and blasting President Trump for ""trying to undermine the election"" by making it more difficult to vote.		

What is President Trump's stance on mail voting during the COVID-19 pandemic?		
Voting rights groups and many Democrats are ratcheting up pressure to make mail voting more available nationwide in response to the coronavirus pandemic, but President Trump is standing in opposition.		

Has voting by mail been a long-standing practice in the US, supported by both parties?		
Trump’s attempts to unify Republicans to oppose voting by mail have not yet succeeded. In part this is because voting by mail is not a recent occurrence: Republicans—especially at the state and local levels—have been part of a movement for decades to support mail-in balloting, according to former Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour.		

What is the basis of Donald Trump's concerns about voting by mail, and how does it relate to his statement about mail-in voting?		
Trump’s concerns about mail-in voting appears to come from a belief that the practice benefits Democrats.		

Did Joe Biden ever say that voting by mail is a way to “fundamentally change this country”?		
While Trump has complained that voting by mail was “ripe for fraud,” Republican state officials in Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia have all taken steps to ease access to mail-in ballots, following health officials’ warnings that voting in person can risk transmission of the deadly virus.

759,"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that “with all the technology we have, we don't need actual classrooms.”","Is technology a necessary component of K-12 classrooms according to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo?		
While traditional classrooms don’t necessarily need technology to facilitate instruction, technology has become a crucial aspect of a lot of K-12 classrooms.		

Does Cuomo believe that technology alone can replace the resources available in traditional classrooms?		
In addition, traditional classrooms often provide students with access to various resources, such as textbooks, materials, and technology, which can enhance their learning experience.		

What does New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo believe is unnecessary in the modern classroom?		
Incorporating technology into the classroom enriches the learning experience, enhances engagement, and prepares students for the technology-driven world.		

Does Cuomo's statement suggest that he supports the use of online education?		
Online education is becoming increasingly common and offers many benefits, including increased flexibility and compatibility with work schedules, the ability of students to access educational materials from a distance, the ability to self-pace learning, and savings in classroom space and faculty staffing (Garrison and Vaughan, 2008; Means et al., 2010).		

Does New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo support the idea of replacing traditional classrooms with remote learning?		
“Remote learning, in any form, will never replace the important personal connection between teachers and their students that is built in the classroom and is a critical part of the teaching and learning process,” said Andy Pallotta, president of the state teachers union, in a statement.		

Does Cuomo believe that technology can replace traditional classrooms?		
However, for now, face-to-face instruction provides dynamic learning attributes not found in Web-based teaching (Kemp and Grieve, 2014).		

Does Cuomo believe that technology can replace traditional classroom learning?		
Classroom learning is always better than virtual learning as it is more effective and engaging. For attending online classes, students require technology, which might not be affordable and available to those living in rural areas.		

Is technology a replacement for traditional classrooms in the remote learning environment?		
With this new teaching environment, however, technology’s role in remote learning is very different. Rather than supporting, enhancing, and transforming instruction, technology is now indispensable to the remote classroom.		

What changes to the education system is Cuomo considering with the help of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation?		
Cuomo also announced a partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to evaluate possible changes to the education system, including providing more opportunities to students, using technology to reduce educational inequality, and recreating larger class or lecture hall environments with virtual classrooms.		

What type of students does most of the existing research on online learning focus on?		
Much of the extant research on online learning has focused on students who might begin at a disadvantage because they do not have the skills to interact confidently with the technology (e.g., Zhang and Perris, 2004).

Does flu vaccination reduce the risk of flu-related death?		
Many studies, including from KPWHRI, show that flu vaccination protects against getting the flu. About 80 percent of pediatric deaths from flu are in unvaccinated children, but a study in 2017 showed flu vaccination reduces risk of flu death by at least 50 percent.		

Do flu vaccines provide significant protection against flu and flu-like illnesses?		
Vaccines didn't significantly reduce the participants' risk for flu, flu-like illness, or pneumonia. With well-matched vaccines, risk reductions were 26% for hospitalization for flu or pneumonia and 42% for all-cause mortality.		

Does the flu vaccine increase the risk of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)?

Does the flu vaccine reduce the likelihood of hospitalization and death in certain groups?		
WASHINGTON, D.C. – The influenza (flu) vaccine can not only prevent illness that may cause a week or more of misery, it can reduce the likelihood of hospitalization in children and death in adults, according to two analyses of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-supported U.S. influenza surveillance data being presented at IDWeek 2019.		

Do flu vaccines reduce the risk of catching the flu in healthy adults under the age of 65?		
In healthy adults under the age of 65, flu vaccines work, too. A 2010 Cochrane review, also co-authored by Jefferson, estimated that during “good” vaccine years—when the vaccines match the circulating viral strain well, which Jefferson says happens about half the time—the vaccine reduces the relative risk that an adult under 65 will catch the flu by about 75 percent.		

Does flu vaccination increase the risk of getting a serious infection?		
In general, seasonal flu vaccine has not been found to increase the risk for GBS. If a risk exists, it is low (i.e., approximately one additional case per 1 million persons vaccinated).		

Does the flu vaccine reduce the risk of having to go to the doctor with the flu?		
- During seasons when flu vaccine viruses are similar to circulating flu viruses, flu vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of having to go to the doctor with flu by 40% to 60%.

But experts had been warning about the impact of COVID-19 from the beginning. Towards the end of February, the CDC issued an outline of what ""could"" happen in the US if the virus continued to spread.		

Was the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. from February 2020 to May 2020 predictable based on the initial alert from the CDC in January 2020?		
Though initially discovered in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, COVID-19 entered the conversation in the U.S. in January 2020, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) alerted the nation of the outbreak abroad.		

Did the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S spread exponentially from February 2020 to May 2020, and was this spread unexpected?		
For example, in the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, 300 cases and 5 deaths already had occurred by the time China reported the outbreak to the WHO, whereas in the COVID-19 outbreak, only 27 cases and zero deaths had occurred when the WHO was notified (January 3, 2020) (Figure 2).

Based on the findings from our analysis, the COVID-19 in China may end up soon. Despite a delay of 43 days from the first confirmed cases on December 8, 2019 to January 20, 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic was highly responsive to massive interventions, supporting the effectiveness of these interventions.		

Did Larry Kudlow say that the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. from February 2020 to May 2020 was something that virtually no one could have predicted?

When did the first evidence of community spread of SARS-Cov-2 in the United States appear?		
The first evidence of community spread of SARS-Cov-2, the virus which causes COVID-19, in the United States appeared in February 2020.		

Did the COVID-19 infection have a latent period in the US from January 21, 2020 to February 4, 2020?		
This result was also picked up by the exponential modeling. From day one on January 21, 2020 when the massive intervention measures activated to February 4, 2020 is the latent period of COVID-19 infection.		

Did the model used to predict COVID-19 spread in China accurately predict the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S from February 2020 to May 2020?		
The researchers tested the model’s efficacy using COVID-19 data from China. With an accuracy of a few days, their model predicted key events in the outbreak’s growth, spread, and decline of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei, and the rest of China—including the peak of new cases, the peak of active cases, and the subsidence of the epidemic.		

What was the global health situation like in March 2020, according to the World Health Organization?		
The COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11. It is currently a global public health threat and more than 100 countries including Italy, Iran, the United States, South Korea, and Japan are suffering from COVID-19.

820,Wisconsin US has no contact tracing program (during COVID-19 pandemic) we can speak of.,"What methods were used by some states to supplement their contact tracing efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic?		
Manual contact tracing, in which trained personnel conduct interviews with those who have tested positive for the virus (“cases”), requires a large workforce and cannot keep pace with the mounting number of COVID-19 infections.1–3 Therefore, some states introduced contact tracing mobile applications (apps) to augment their contact tracing efforts.4–6		

Does Wisconsin have a contact tracing program during the COVID-19 pandemic?		
A solution that is increasingly being relied upon is COVID-19 contact tracing. Public Health Ontario defined contact tracing in an online notice linking to a Government of Canada website portal soliciting volunteers for the National COVID-19 Volunteer Recruitment Campaign as “a process that is used to identify, educate and monitor individuals who have had close contact with someone who is infected with a virus.

Contact tracing is a public health practice used for infectious disease response. State and local public health systems have performed contact tracing for diseases such as tuberculosis and syphilis.		

Did Wisconsin have a contact tracing program in place during the COVID-19 pandemic?		
- April 30, 2020 – The Governor announced the state’s contact tracing pilot program will begin in the coming weeks, which will include a baseline of 30 contact tracers for every 100,000 individuals and will utilize additional tracers based on the projected number of cases in each region.		

Are there any U.S. states or cities that have implemented a contact tracing program during the COVID-19 pandemic?		
Efforts to expand contact tracing have occurred piecemeal in some U.S. states and cities, and perhaps not quickly enough.		

Is there a traditional contact tracing program in place in Wisconsin during the COVID-19 pandemic?		
Contact tracing is an important part of the public health response to infectious diseases. Traditional contact tracing occurs manually: State or local public health authorities receive the contact information of persons who have tested positive for an infectious disease, and those people are interviewed by public health officials to identify, contact, and isolate their close and/or casual contacts.		

Does Wisconsin have a contact tracing program in place during the COVID-19 pandemic?		
In Massachusetts, PIH and the Community Tracing Collaborative have already begun supporting the state’s efforts by training and deploying hundreds of contact tracers, who are calling people who have been in close contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients.		

What were the challenges faced by contact tracing programs in other states during the COVID-19 pandemic?		
Unpublished observations of contact tracing practices and reports during the outbreak showed that massive recruitment of contact tracers, which was fraught with political interference, recruitment of unsuitable (and often unmotivated contact tracers), and inability to agree on standardized procedures for contact tracing also compromised the quality of contact tracing practices in WA.		

What were some of the challenges associated with effective contact tracing during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US?

821,Probability of Coronavirus could reduce from 70% to 1.5% if the COVID-19 carrier and a healthy person are both wearing masks.,"Can masks be 100% effective in preventing disease transmission?		
Some empirical studies find masks to be effective in preventing disease transmission, whereas others do not.16,18–26 We determined that the studies that did not find masks to be effective were under-powered to such an extent that even if masks were 100% effective, they still would have been unlikely to find a statistically significant result.		

How effective are masks in reducing the transmission of coronavirus?		
However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is a main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly fivefold protection versus no barrier alone (although others have found lower levels of effectiveness).		

Does wearing a mask by both a COVID-19 carrier and a healthy person reduce the probability of transmission?		
A number of studies have shown the inefficacy of the surgical mask in household settings to prevent transmission of the influenza virus,6,7 but Smith and colleagues,8 in a recently published meta-analysis, concluded that the surgical mask was noninferior to the N95 mask in terms of influenza transmission rates among health care workers.		

Does wearing both N95 respirators and medical masks reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission by up to 80%?		
Nonetheless, our meta-analysis revealed that use of both N95 respirators and medical masks was associated with up to 80% reduction in risk of SARS.		

How effective are masks in reducing the probability of contracting the Coronavirus?		
The study, published in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases in 2008, found that masks were 80% effective in protecting against clinical influenza-like illness when worn consistently — but there was a catch.		

Does wearing a mask by both the COVID-19 carrier and a healthy person reduce the probability of disease transmission?		
Results: When the adherence to mask usage guidelines is taken into account, the empirical evidence indicates that masks prevent disease transmission: all studies we analysed that did not find surgical masks to be effective were under-powered to such an extent that even if masks were 100% effective, the studies in question would still have been unlikely to find a statistically significant effect.		

What were the pre-pandemic empirical studies on the effectiveness of masks against respiratory viruses showing?		
Background: Pre-pandemic empirical studies have produced mixed statistical results on the effectiveness of masks against respiratory viruses, leading to confusion that may have contributed to organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initially not recommending that the general public wear masks during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.		

How effective are cloth masks in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 compared to not wearing a mask at all?		
Can research findings from studies on medical grade masks be extrapolated to cloth masks? Although good quality evidence is lacking, some data suggest that cloth masks may be only marginally (15%) less effective than surgical masks in blocking emission of particles, and fivefold more effective than not wearing masks.12 Therefore, cloth masks are likely to be better than wearing no mask at all.		

Does wearing a mask reduce the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 from a COVID-19 carrier to the environment and external mask surface?		
Bae et al. (2020) evaluated the effectiveness of surgical and cotton masks in filtering SARSCoV-2.10 They found that neither kind of mask reduced the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 from the coughs of four symptomatic patients with COVID-19 to the environment and external mask surface.

Wisconsin appears to have slowed the rate of coronavirus infection. According to the state Department of Health Services, the number of cases in the state was doubling every 3 or 4 days in early March before Safer at Home was enacted.		

Did the Safer at Home plan implemented in Wisconsin during the COVID-19 pandemic result in a reduction in COVID-19 related deaths?		
Days after Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers announced the state's Safer-at-Home order on March 24, 2020, a subtly misleading framework for Wisconsin's COVID-19 projections appeared on Twitter.		

Has the Safer at Home plan in Wisconsin, US, been implemented to slow the spread of COVID-19?		
Wisconsin is under a Safer at Home order, until at least April 24, 2020, to slow the spread of COVID-19.		

What is one of the conditions that Wisconsin must meet before it can lift the Safer at Home order and begin to reopen under the plan?		
Before Wisconsin can lift the Safer at Home order and begin to reopen, among other factors the plan says that Wisconsin must first see a 14-day downward trajectory of coronavirus case numbers as a percentage of total tests.		

According to Gov. Evers, what is the estimated number of lives saved in Wisconsin due to the Safer at Home plan?		
Evers says “safer at home” measures are flattening the curve of the virus’ spread and have already saved hundreds of lives in Wisconsin.		

Did the Safer at Home plan in Wisconsin assume it would be implemented earlier than it actually was?		
Ali Mokdad, a senior faculty member at the institute, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel the original model – started around the beginning of March – assumed Wisconsin would have a Safer at Home-style order in place about two weeks sooner than it did.		

According to the evidence, what was the predicted number of deaths in Wisconsin if the Safer at Home order had not been implemented?		
A grim forecast from a few weeks ago — when DHS officials said that without the Safer at Home order the number of infections could explode to 22,000 by April 8 and the number of deaths could reach 400 to more than three times that amount — has been avoided because the public is taking Safer at Home seriously, Evers and Palm said.		

Has the number of positive COVID-19 tests in Wisconsin been below 100 since the Safer at Home plan took effect?		
For the first time since Gov. Tony Evers' safer-at-home order took effect March 25, Wisconsin's single-day increase in positive COVID-19 tests was below 100 on Monday.		

According to Governor Evers, what is the estimated range of lives saved by the stay-at-home order in Wisconsin since March 25?		
Evers stood firm, saying the stay-at-home order in place since March 25 has already saved between 300 and 1,400 lives.		

What was the purpose of the Safer at Home plan implemented in Wisconsin during the COVID-19 pandemic?		
The order was put in place to slow the spread of COVID-19, which as of Thursday had infected 3,875 Wisconsinites and killed 197.

Does the Covid-19 virus pose a risk to children's health, even if they are generally less severely affected than other age groups?		
Though children with COVID-19 generally seem to have less serious illness than other age groups, there is also a risk that children with underlying health conditions such as severe asthma or cystic fibrosis, or those whose immune systems are compromised, will require hospitalization and intensive care when contracting COVID-19.		

Does the Covid-19 virus have a significant impact on the health of children under the age of 20?		
Generally, COVID-19 seems to be a less severe disease for children than adults. Approximately 90% of pediatric patients are diagnosed as asymptomatic, mild, or moderate disease.		

Does the claim that the Covid-19 virus is a miracle of miracles, a miracle of miracles, because children do not die, do not get ill, do not end up in intensive care up to 20 years old, align with the evidence that serious COVID-19 illness resulting in hospitalization still occurs in children up to 20 years old?		
Whereas most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious COVID-19 illness resulting in hospitalization still occurs in this age group,” the CDC said.		

Does the Covid-19 virus have no severe effects on children up to the age of 20?		
Whereas most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious COVID-19 illness resulting in hospitalization still occurs in this age group.

Children have been less affected by severe illness from COVID-19 than adults, though they can also experience severe symptoms up to and including death.		

Do children under the age of 20 experience severe or critical cases of Covid-19?		
The study showed that about 30 percent of childhood Covid-19 cases deemed “severe” and more than half of Covid-19 cases deemed “critical” were among children less than 1 year old.		

Do children under 20 years old experience severe illness or death from COVID-19?		
A CDC report published April 6, entitled ""Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Children,"" says, ""Although most cases reported among children to date have not been severe, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 infection in children and monitor for progression of illness, particularly among infants and children with underlying conditions.""		

Do children under the age of 20 years old die, get ill, or end up in intensive care due to COVID-19?		
Meanwhile, in adults, those rates jumped to 10 to 33 percent and 1.4 to 4.5 percent, respectively. “Whereas most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious COVID-19 illness resulting in hospitalization still occurs in this age group,” the CDC warned.		

Are children who are unvaccinated, immune compromised, or have complex medical conditions more likely to experience severe illness from COVID-19?		
In the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, children were less likely to experience severe infection. We continue to see severe illness leading to hospitalization in the pediatric population among children who are unvaccinated, children who are immune compromised, and those with complex medical conditions.

845,Being long term unemployed for a year or over nearly halves your chances of ever getting back into employment.,"What is the relationship between the duration of unemployment and the chances of getting back into employment?		
This clearly shows that reemployment probabilities are lower for workers who have been unemployed for over six months than for those unemployed for less than six months, suggesting some link between long-term unemployment and damage to reemployment prospects.		

What is the average rate at which people who have been unemployed for a short time find employment?		
Unsurprisingly, the rate at which the long-term unemployed find work is lower than that of those who have been unemployed for only a short time; on average over the period from 1994 to 2007, a bit more than one-third of those already unemployed for one to four weeks found employment within the next month.		

What is the impact of long-term unemployment on an individual's chances of finding employment?		
In our recent research on long-term unemployment, we have sought to understand the relative importance of the changing composition of the pool of unemployed individuals over time, the impact of ""duration dependence"" — the possibility that the chance of finding a job depends in part on how long an individual has been unemployed — and labor market nonparticipation in long-term unemployment trends in both the United States and Canada.		

What is the employment probability for individuals who were long-term unemployed one year ago compared to those who were short-term unemployed one year ago?		
Currently, a person who was classified as long-term unemployed one year ago has a 38 percent probability of being employed today, which is only a touch below the same probability before the recession; moreover, in relative terms it is only moderately below the probability that someone who was short-term unemployed a year ago is employed today (slightly above 50 percent).		

Has the incidence of long-term unemployment in the past few years changed compared to previous years?		
However, a closer look at the data indicates that the incidence of long-term unemployment has declined over the past few years, and that job prospects for the long-term unemployed are not as downbeat as the average duration data suggest.		

What happens to the chances of someone getting back into employment if they are unemployed for a year or more?		
As shown in Panel A of Figure 2, their monthly probability of moving from unemployment to employment has recovered only modestly and still remains depressed relative to its pre-recession level.3 Moreover, Panel B of Figure 1 indicates that the long-term unemployed are about twice as likely to move to nonparticipation (that is, to drop out of the labor force) as to employment.		

Is there a significant correlation between the duration of unemployment and the likelihood of getting back into employment?		
We also find that longer unemployment durations are associated with lower subsequent earnings, though this is mainly attributable to the long-term unemployed having a lower likelihood of subsequent employment rather than to their having lower earnings once a job is found.		

Does the length of unemployment negatively impact an individual's chances of finding employment?		
Individuals who are unemployed for longer durations tend to have more difficulty finding new jobs, and after the recession, the long-term unemployed made up a significant portion of the labor force, which increased the natural rate of unemployment.		

What is the relationship between the duration of unemployment and the negative impact on mental health and the chances of getting back into employment?		
The longer the duration of unemployment, the greater the negative impact upon mental health. There is evidence that there is a sharp increase in the impact of unemployment on mental health after three months of unemployment, with a further increase occurring after about 30 months of being out of work (Paul & Moser, 2009).		

What are the job prospects of individuals who have been unemployed for a year or more?

A further investigation of air temperature and humidity influence on the transmission of (SARS-CoV-2) reported that for every 1℃ One increase in temperature and 1% increase in relative humidity lowered the R by 0.0383 and 0.0224, respectively.		

Is there a link between the optimal temperature for the structural stability of the SARS virus and the temperature recommended to prevent the transmission of COVID-19?		
This claim was likely derived from studies showing that SARS-CoV (the SARS virus from the early 2000s, not the one that causes COVID-19) exhibits structural stability at relatively low temperatures (22–25°C), though it was never shown that this was associated with it being ""transmitted [between people or between surfaces and people] better in the cold.""		

How does temperature and relative humidity affect the transmission of COVID-19?		
Results: Statistically significant negative correlations are found between temperature/relative humidity and the effective reproductive number (R value) in both China and the U.S. Conclusions: Higher temperature and higher relative humidity potentially suppress the transmission of COVID-19.		

At what humidity levels does the coronavirus responsible for the common cold persist longer?		
At room temperature, a coronavirus responsible for the common cold (HCoV-229E) persisted significantly longer in 50% humidity than 30% humidity.		

Does the evidence suggest that temperature has a significant impact on the transmission of COVID-19?		
Not all of the studies we found suggested weather as an influence on transmission. An analysis of the reproductive number (R0) of (SARS-CoV-2) across China reported that changes in weather alone (i.e., increase of temperature and humidity) would not necessarily lead to declines in cases.		

How does temperature and relative humidity affect the transmission of COVID-19?		
Statistically significant negative correlations are found between temperature/relative humidity and the effective reproductive number (R value) in both China and the U.S. Higher temperature and higher relative humidity potentially suppress the transmission of COVID-19.		

Does the optimal temperature for the replication of the rhinovirus, which causes the common cold, also apply to the COVID-19 virus?		
Some viruses are actually more likely to spread during cold weather. Rhinovirus (the cause of the common cold) replicates better at cooler temperatures, such as those found in the nose (33° to 35° Celsius) compared to the body core temperature (33° to 37° Celsius).

What type of exercise is recommended for people with chronic bronchitis to maintain lung health?		
For those with chronic bronchitis, the idea of exercise may seem daunting. However, regular cardiovascular activity is key to maintaining lung health during and after episodes.		

Does running half an hour twice a day improve lung function in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?		
Physical training improves exercise capacity and outcomes for patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but there is little evidence that it improves lung function [1, 2].		

Is running recommended for patients with dry coughs?		
- In general, any kind of dry cough is probably not good for running. Wet coughs—a cough where mucus or phlegm comes out—may be caused by sinus or throat issues and may be okay for cardiovascular exercise.		

Can people with pre-existing respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD safely engage in physical activities like running for half an hour twice a day?		
For people without respiratory disease, this is generally not a problem as the body can manage the additional work to breathe comfortably, but psychological stressors can exacerbate breathing problems for people with pre-existing respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis).

However, there are some vaccines created from cell lines (such as WI-38, MRC-5, HEK-293, PER C6, and WI-26) that were derived from tissue taken from aborted fetuses from the 1960s.		

Do all vaccines contain MRC-5 cells, which are aborted fetal cells?		
While many of the common childhood vaccines used today were developed using the WI-38 and MRC-5 fetal cell lines, there are some vaccines available that were developed using animal cell lines.		

Are there any vaccines that are produced using MRC-5 cells?		
A few human fetal cell lines (WI-38, MRC-5) are still in use for some vaccine production.[24] However, few vaccines are now produced using fetal cell lines, and none using fetal tissue.		

Which cell lines are used in the production of certain vaccines, including the hepatitis A vaccine and the adenovirus vaccine?		
Other vaccines are made in the WI-38 and MRC-5 cell lines. The hepatitis A vaccine is made in the MRC-5 cells, and a vaccine that protects members of the U.S. military from a common respiratory infection called adenovirus is made using the WI-38 cells.		

Do vaccines contain MRC-5 cells, which are of human origin?		
Those used in vaccine manufacture include two diploid cell strains of human origin (MRC-5 and WI-38), simian-derived continuous and diploid cell lines, chick embryo and chick embryo fibro-blasts.14 Residual proteins from these cell lines may be present to a varying degree in the vaccines produced from them.		

Which type of fetal cells are used in the production of the COVID-19 vaccine (J&J/Janssen)?		
All vaccines made using fetal cells, except the COVID-19 vaccine, are made using fibroblast cells. The COVID-19 vaccine (J&J/Janssen) is made using fetal retinal cells.		

Do some vaccines contain MRC-5 cells, which are derived from aborted fetal cells?		
The earliest aborted fetal cell-produced vaccines such as Meruvax (rubella) and MMR II do not even inform consumers that the vaccines contain contaminating DNA from the cell used to produce them.		

What type of cells are commonly used for culturing in the production of vaccines?		
Ethically compromised vaccines are cultured in cell lines known as human diploid cells. The most commonly utilised cell lines are, WI-38 (Wistar Institute) and MRC-5 (Medical Research Council).		

Which vaccines have been produced using MRC-5 cells, a type of aborted fetal cell line?		
This second cell line was named MRC-5. Ultimately, the rubella vaccine and one rabies vaccine were made using WI-38 cells, but due to concerns around legal and supply issues during the 1970s when other vaccines were being developed, the vaccines against hepatitis A, chickenpox and the original shingles vaccine were made using the MRC-5 cells.		

Are MRC-5 cells used in the ongoing production of vaccines?		
The cell lines MRC-5 and WI-38 were frequently used for the development of vaccines. There has been no new fetal cells required in the ongoing production of vaccines nor is there fetal tissue in vaccines.

863,Chinese products can be identified by the first three digits of a barcode,"Does the first three digits of a barcode always represent the country of origin of the manufacturer?		
In an EAN-13 or UPC barcode, the first two digits often represent the country code of the manufacturer, although this is not strictly about geographic location but more about where the manufacturer’s business is registered.		

What information does the first three digits of a barcode provide about a product?		
Barcode prefixes do not provide identification of origin for a specific product. They merely provide number capacity to different countries for the assignment of barcode prefixes by the GS1.		

Does the first three digits of a barcode identify the country of origin of a Chinese product?		
GS1 prefixes do not identify the country of origin for a given product. The next 5 digits identify the Company which has purchased the barcodes.		

Does the first three digits of a barcode uniquely identify the country of origin of a Chinese product?		
Unlike UPC codes, which have 12 digits, EAN codes have 13 digits. The first 3 digits are the “Country Code” aka: GS1 Prefix, and indicate the GS1 Member Organization where the manufacturer registered the bar codes.		

Does the GS1 country member organization issue UPC or EAN codes that can be used to identify the country of origin of a product?		
GS1 has member organizations in just about every country. It is true that the first 2 digits of a UPC or 3 digits of an EAN code indicate the GS1 country member organization by which that UPC or EAN code was issued.		

Does the first three digits of a barcode necessarily indicate the country of origin of a product?		
Also, the EAN-13 country codes indicate the country or economic region where the barcode was assigned, and might not be the country where the product was made.		

What do the first three digits of a barcode on a Chinese product typically represent?		
The first three digits of the EAN-13 (GS1 Prefix) usually identify the GS1 Member Organization which the manufacturer has joined (not necessarily where the product is actually made).[6] Note that EAN-13 codes beginning with 0 are actually 12-digit UPC codes with prepended 0 digit.		

What information does the first three digits of a barcode provide about a product?		
The GS1 prefix or country code, the manufacturer code, the product code, and the check digit. As it was designed with the purpose of international use in mind, the country code easily gives information about the country of origin of a product while the manufacturer code is unique to every producer.		

Do the first three digits of a barcode indicate the country or economic region where a product was assigned, rather than the country where it was made?		
Moreover, what those EAN-13 country codes indicate is the country or economic region where a particular bar code was assigned, not necessarily the country where the product identified by that bar code was made:		

What do the first 6-9 digits in a barcode represent?		
Those digits in a barcode- they actually mean something. The first 6-9 digits, known as the company prefix, is a unique identifier of the product’s manufacturer.

864,There is always the possibility of an iatrogenic reaction to a vaccine.,"What is the likelihood of experiencing an iatrogenic reaction to a vaccine?		
All vaccines have possible side effects. Most, however, are mild and temporary. Adverse effects from vaccines are thoroughly monitored via multiple reporting systems, and there is no evidence from these systems to support these claims.		

What are some potential risks associated with the use of vaccines?		
The use of vaccines is not without risks, however. It is well established, for example, that the oral polio vaccine can on rare occasion cause paralytic polio, that some influenza vaccines have been associated with a risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome, and that vaccines sometimes cause anaphylactic shock.		

How common are iatrogenic reactions to vaccines?		
Although allergic reactions are a common concern for vaccine providers, these reactions are uncommon and anaphylaxis following vaccines is rare, occurring at a rate of approximately one per million doses for many vaccines (5).		

What is the likelihood of experiencing an iatrogenic reaction to a vaccine?		
The risk is extremely small and normally it is vastly outweighed by the benefits of vaccines. According to the WHO, ‘so few deaths can plausibly be attributed to vaccines that it is hard to assess the risk statistically’, and ‘serious adverse events occur rarely (on the order of one per thousands to one per millions of doses)’ (WHO, 2018).		

What types of adverse reactions can occur as a result of vaccination?		
All vaccines might cause adverse reactions (82). Vaccine adverse reactions are classified by three general categories: local, syst		

What types of adverse events or side effects does VAERS report after a person has received a vaccination?		
VAERS accepts and analyzes reports of adverse events (possible side effects) after a person has received a vaccination.		

What are the potential adverse reactions that can occur after receiving the MMR vaccine?		
Surveillance of adverse reactions in the United States and other countries indicates that MMR vaccine can, in rare circumstances, cause clinically apparent thrombocytopenia within the 2 months after vaccination.		

What is the relationship between adverse events reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and the actual side effects caused by vaccination?		
Adverse events reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) are not necessarily side effects caused by vaccination.		

What is the likelihood of experiencing an adverse reaction after receiving a vaccine?		
Modern vaccines are safe and effective; however, adverse events have been reported after administration of all vaccines (82).

884,"""The 1st Amendment comes before the 13th and 14th, and the Bible clearly approves of owning slaves"" stated David Green on Fox News this morning.","Does the Bible support or condemn the practice of owning slaves as claimed by David Green on Fox News?		
So no, the Bible does not endorse slavery nor the evils inherent in slavery. On the contrary, it abolishes them in the name of Jesus.		

Does the Bible approve of owning slaves?		
Passed by Congress on January 31, 1865, and ratified on December 6, 1865, the 13th amendment abolished slavery in the United States and provides that ""Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction."".		

Does the Bible explicitly approve of owning slaves?		
The Bible could, of course, be read in more than one way. Some Christians gave priority to the letter of the law, to those verses that seemed to ordain slavery, while others, like Douglass, stressed what they took to be the spirit of the whole Bible, a message of inclusiveness and equality.		

Does the 14th Amendment limit the effectiveness of the 1st Amendment as stated by David Green on Fox News?		
See Akhil Reed Amar, The Bill Of Rights 163–180 (1998). As discussed earlier, however, the Court limited the effectiveness of that clause soon after the ratification of the 14th Amendment.		

Does the evidence support the claim that the Bible approves of owning slaves?		
Passage of the Reconstruction Amendments (13th, 14th, and 15th) gave the federal courts the authority to intervene when a state threatened fundamental rights of its citizens,39 and one of the most important doctrines ﬂowing from this is the application of the Bill of Rights to the states through the Due Process Clause.40 Through the process of “selective incorporation,” most of the provisions of the first eight Amendments, such as free speech, freedom of religion, and protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, are applied against the states as they are against the federal government.		

Does the Bible's discussion of slavery necessarily imply approval of the harsh slavery that existed in the United States?		
But was slavery that is discussed in the Bible the same as the harsh slavery? For example, slaves and masters are referred to in Paul’s epistles.		

Does David Green believe that the 14th Amendment contradicts the Bible?		
Ratified in 1868, the 14th Amendment increased the liberties and rights granted by the Bill of Rights to former slaves.		

What amendments to the US Constitution does David Green claim are inferior to the 1st Amendment?		
guaranteed by the Bill of Rights and by the 13th, 14th, 15th, and 19th Amendments, as well as by legislation such as

885,Trump Claims ‘Ultimate Authority’ to Override States’ Virus Measures,"Does the US Constitution grant the President the authority to override state decisions regarding virus measures?		
No federal statute gives the president the authority to override state decisions. Nor does he possess this inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution.		

Under what constitutional provisions does the federal government have the authority to impose quarantines, and what is the relationship between federal and state authority in this regard?		
Again, this is so because the federal government's authority to impose quarantines stems from the commerce clause's grant of federal authority to regulate foreign and interstate commerce, while the 10th Amendment reserves police powers to the states.		

Would the federal government's measures to reopen the country for business override state measures to preserve health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic?		
But the application of the following principles to the potential conflict between states and the federal government in the context of COVID-19 pandemic — where the states have adopted stricter measures than the federal government to preserve health and safety — most likely would result in state policies trumping Trump's efforts to open the country for business before governors agree.		

What powers do federal and state governments have to enact laws protecting public health?		
The authority of federal and state governments to enact laws protecting public health extends to the promulgation of regulations, the issuance of executive orders, and the publication of directives from health authorities that may have the force and effect of law (Box 13.1).		

How would the federal government's relaxation of social distancing guidelines affect the current measures implemented by the states to combat the spread of COVID-19?		
But if the federal government were to relax social distancing guidelines, the states' COVID-19 measures (at least in their current form) would be more restrictive, not ""insufficient"" vis-à-vis the federal government's policy, to stopping the spread of the disease.		

What is the basis for the federal government's authority to prescribe a quarantine and other health measures in the United States?		
For example, the basis for the federal government's authority to prescribe a quarantine and other health measures is based on the commerce clause, which gives Congress exclusive authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce.		

Does the Constitution grant the President the authority to override state measures in response to the virus?		
If the Constitution empowers Congress and the President to make an appropriate response, is there anything in the Tenth Amendment, ""in historical understanding and practice, in the structure of the Constitution, [or] in the jurisprudence of this Court,"" ante, at 905, that forbids the enlistment of state officers to make that response effective?		

What authority does the Commerce Clause provide in the context of public health emergencies?		
Again, in practice, those clauses have been read to grant broad authorities to the federal government in public health emergencies, and the Commerce Clause provides the basis for foreign and interstate isolation and quarantine authority.		

What authority does the federal government have to impose quarantines for public health under the statute mentioned in the evidence?		
The statute authorizing the federal government to impose quarantines for public health gives considerable authority to the Surgeon General, who in turn has delegated that authority to the Centers for Disease Control.		

What levels of government have the authority to impose quarantine or isolation measures?		
All levels of government have the authority to impose quarantine or isolation. The federal government’s authority is under the PHSA, while state, territorial, tribal, and local officials have inherent authority, usually governed by a particular statute.

929,"Government of India is monitoring all forms of communications, both online and telephonic.","Is the Indian government allowed to conduct mass surveillance of all forms of communications?		
There are no laws that allow for mass surveillance in India. The two laws covering interception are the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885 and the Information Technology Act of 2000, as amended in 2008, and they restrict lawful interception to time-limited and targeted interception.		

Is the Government of India allowed to monitor all forms of communications, both online and telephonic, under current laws?		
India currently does not have formal privacy legislation to prohibit arbitrary monitoring. The new system comes under the jurisdiction of the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885, which allows for monitoring communication in the “interest of public safety.”		

Does the Indian government have the authority to monitor all forms of communications in India?		
Yes, the Indian Telegraph Act 1885 and the Information Technology Act 2000 permit the government to engage in surveillance based on certain criteria that is in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states, public order or for prevention of incitement of the commission of an offence.		

What is the framework that governs the lawful interception and monitoring of communications in India?		
Government of India on 2015-12-02 in a reply to parliament question no. 595 on scope, objectives and framework of the CMS has struck a balance between national security, online privacy and free speech informed that to take care of the privacy of citizens, lawful interception and monitoring is governed by the Section 5(2) of Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 read with Rule 419A of Indian Telegraph (Amendment) Rules, 2007 wherein oversight mechanism exists in form of review committee under chairmanship of the Cabinet Secretary at Central Government level and Chief Secretary of the State at the State Government level.		

What laws in India are used to monitor digital communications?		
Current surveillance laws in India are mostly remnants from India’s pre-technological colonial past. However, in our technological age, the most important tools for surveillance are in the digital space; digital surveillance is dealt with under two different statutes, the Telegraph Act 1885 (which deals with interception of calls) and the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) (which deals with interception of data).		

Under what circumstances can the Indian Government intercept communications?		
This mass surveillance system is merely regulated under Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, which empowers the Indian Government to intercept communications on the occurence of any “public emergency” or in the interest of “public safety”, when it is deemed “necessary or expedient” to do so in the following instances:		

Does the IT Act and the Telegraph Act address the centralised collection and storage of data by government authorities?		
Similarly, while the IT Act and the Telegraph Act do contain provisions with respect to data retention and interception of communications, these do not address the centralised collection and storage of data by government authorities.13		

What forms of communication is the Indian government allowed to intercept according to the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 and the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000?		
The laws governing this are the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, which deals with interception of calls, and the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000, which deals with interception of data.		

What regulations were put in place by the Indian government to monitor online and telephonic communications?		
The Central government passed the IT (Procedure and Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption of Information) Rules, 2009, that allow the Secretary in the Home Ministry/Home Departments to authorise agencies to intercept, decrypt or monitor Internet traffic or electronic data.		

Under what conditions can the government of India monitor communications?		
But this right is not unbridled or absolute. The Central government, under Section 69 of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000, has the power to impose reasonable restrictions on this right and intercept, decrypt or monitor Internet traffic or electronic data whenever there is a threat to national security, national integrity, security of the state, and friendly relations with other countries, or in the interest of public order and decency, or to prevent incitement to commission of an offence.

According to recent evidence, the diagnostic accuracy of many of the currently available RT-PCR tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 may be lower than optimal (i.e. <100%).		

What are the limitations of the RT-PCR test in detecting Covid-19?		
Laboratory-based evaluations of currently used RT-PCR tests show high analytical sensitivity and near-perfect specificity with no misidentification of other common respiratory pathogens,19 but test sensitivity is typically lower due to variation in how specimens are obtained and handled, the stage of illness when testing is performed, and potential mutations or deletions in the viral genome that the assay targets for detection.20,21 In recent research and clinical practice, serial testing has been used to establish the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the setting of high clinical suspicion.		

Is the RT-PCR test used to detect Covid-19?		
RT-PCR is widely used to detect the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome.[39]		

What is the accuracy of the RT-PCR test in detecting Covid-19?		
RT-PCR is considered the most accurate method of diagnosis, with 90 to 100 percent sensitivity (the rate of true positive results) and specificity (the rate of true negative results) depending on the strain, patient age, and day of testing.		

What is the accuracy of the RT-PCR test in detecting Covid-19?		
For accurate diagnosis, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) is considered the gold standard. Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs), although fast and convenient, often produce false-negative results.		

Does the RT-PCR test accurately detect Covid-19?		
In diagnosis, the sensitivity of RT-PCR for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 has been quantified as 63% in nasal swab and 32% in pharyngeal swab,14 which is similar to our results; we found a positive rate of only 59.5% in patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19.		

Why does the World Health Organization consider RT-PCR tests the ""gold standard"" for detecting Covid-19 if they do not detect the virus?		
South Korea generally uses RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) tests, which the World Health Organization (WHO) says are the “gold standard” for detecting Covid-19.		

Is the RT-PCR test effective in detecting Covid-19?		
PCR Tests: PCR tests are the “gold standard” for COVID-19 tests. They are a type of nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), which are more likely to detect the virus than antigen tests.		

Is the RT-PCR test effective in detecting Covid-19?		
- RT-PCR is a highly sensitive and highly specific testing modality for detection of influenza A and B viral RNA in respiratory specimens, though the results may take 4–6 hours or more once testing is started, and RT-PCR may not be available at all clinical sites.		

What does the RT-PCR test detect?

Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 particles are spherical and have proteins called spikes protruding from their surface.		

What is the relationship between the size of exosomes and their appearance in microscope images?		
The exosomes' role may depend highly on size, and the size of exosomes varies from 30 to 300 nm. The most widely used method for exosome imaging is negative staining, while other results are based on Cryo-Transmission Electron Microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy, and Atomic Force Microscopy.		

Do the images of exosomes and the virus that causes Covid-19 appear to be similar in microscope images according to David Icke's claim?		
MV and exosomes are round and vesicular (Fig. 1D) and distinct from one another and from HIV-1 in size, structure, and electron density.		

What is the shape of exosomes as observed in microscope images?		
Quickly frozen, vitrified vesicles analyzed by cryo–electron microscopy indeed show that exosomes and other EVs have a perfectly rounded shape (Fig. 1 and not depicted; Conde-Vancells et al., 2008).		

What is the relationship between exosomes and the virus that causes Covid-19 according to the evidence provided?		
Although exosomes are generally thought of as free extracellular vesicles, our live cell imaging results and EM images, together with published micrographs of B cell exosomes (Raposo et al., 1996; Simons and Raposo, 2009), suggested to us that exosomes can have an alternative fate: to stay closely associated with the cell that produced them.		

Are the exosomes mentioned in the evidence similar in size to the virus that causes Covid-19?		
The vesicles isolated from saliva, plasma and breast milk, were shown by electron microscopy to have a diameter of 50-80 nm, which is comparable with previously identified exosomes [2–4].		

Does David Icke's claim that Microscope images of exosomes and of the virus that causes Covid-19 are ""exactly the same"" align with the findings of the study that used cryo-electron microscopy and tomography?		
Lastly, we applied cryo-electron microscopy and tomography to confirm these associations between SARS-CoV-2 virions and ACE2+ exosomes.		

Does David Icke's claim that Microscope images of exosomes and of the virus that causes Covid-19 are ""exactly the same"" align with the scientific understanding of the distinct characteristics of exosomes that can be observed through high-resolution microscopy techniques?		
The varying sizes and morphologies of exosomes, depending on their origin and function14, can be distinguished by microscopy techniques with high resolution, such as electron microscopy.		

Are the microscopic images of exosomes and the virus that causes Covid-19 identical?		
Several studies have shown that classical markers of exosomes, such as CD63 and CD81, are enriched in vesicles with features of exosomes but which originate through budding from the plasma membrane and could not be distinguished from exosomes (53, 58, 59).		

What is the typical diameter of exosomes compared to other types of extracellular vesicles?		
We addressed this question in several ways. First, exosomes have the same diameter as ILVs, i.e., 30–100 nm diameter, while other types of extracellular vesicles are much more heterogeneous in size, often up to 1 μm in diameter.

Does the Philippine General Hospital's data suggest that grocery shopping is a primary mode of COVID-19 transmission?		
According to current evidence, COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes.2-7 In an analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, airborne transmission was not reported.7		

Is there any evidence that COVID-19 can be transmitted through grocery shopping?		
COVID-19 is not a foodborne disease. While there have been no reports as of this time to suggest that COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, has been transmitted by handling food or food packaging, here are ways that consumers can protect themselves when grocery shopping.		

Does the Philippine General Hospital's claim of a correlation between grocery shopping and COVID-19 transmission have any scientific basis according to current evidence on the transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2?		
To date there is no direct research-based evidence describing exactly how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted. Many sources say that COVID-19 is transmitted only by droplets and contact, but guidance from leading public health groups on transmission routes are inconsistent and conflicting.		

Does the Philippine General Hospital's data suggest that grocery shopping is a significant mode of COVID-19 transmission?		
Data are thus only somewhat suggestive of contact as a mode of transmission for COVID-19 in community settings and align with CDC advice that it is not the most important mode.		

Can contaminated surfaces in grocery stores be a possible source of COVID-19 transmission?		
Although these data cannot be used to determine whether transmission occurred from contaminated surfaces, further study of fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 aboard cruise ships is warranted.		

Is there a link between grocery shopping and the transmission of COVID-19, according to the Philippine General Hospital?		
COVID-19 is not likely to be transmitted through food itself, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.		

Does the Philippine General Hospital's claim that there is a correlation between grocery shopping and COVID-19 transmission align with the primary mode of transmission identified by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention?		
The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, which has dealt with by far more COVID-19 cases than any other agency, says that COVID-19 transmission occurs primarily by respiratory droplets and close contact, with the ""possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment for a long time exposure to high concentrations of aerosols.""12		

Is there a correlation between grocery shopping and COVID-19 according to the Philippine General Hospital?		
There are reports from settings where symptomatic COVID-19 patients have been admitted and in which no COVID-19 RNA was detected in air samples.11-12 WHO is aware of other studies which have evaluated the presence of COVID-19 RNA in air samples, but which are not yet published in peer-reviewed journals.

947,"Lighting a Diya or candle, can kill Coronavirus.","Is there a type of light that is known to be germicidal and potentially effective in killing pathogens?		
As is well known, ultraviolet light, particularly UVC (200–280nm), is germicidal, but it has not been much developed as an anti-infective approach until recently, when it was realized that the possible adverse effects to host tissue were relatively minor compared to its high activity in killing pathogens.		

Can artificial UV radiation kill coronavirus?		
While the germicidal effect of sunlight has long been known, it has been found that artificial UV radiation with a wavelength of 253.7 nm, can be produced by low pressure mercury vapor lamps.		

Is it possible to kill the Coronavirus through high temperatures?		
Further, the claim that high temperatures will kill coronavirus is in itself dubious. World Health Organisation (WHO) has categorically said ‘no matter how sunny or hot the weather is’ a person can catch coronavirus.		

Can UV light, such as that produced by a Diya or candle, kill the coronavirus?		
UV lights don’t work, either. In short, because the level of UV required to kill COVID-19 is extremely unsafe.		

Does the evidence suggest that UVGI, such as from lighting a Diya or candle, is effective in killing infectious microorganisms?		
We conclude that although UVGI is microbiocidal, it is not ""ready for prime time"" as a primary intervention to kill or inactivate infectious microorganisms; rather, it should be considered an adjunct.		

Does UV-A LED light have antimicrobial properties?		
However, UV-A exposure is insufficient for disinfection. This study demonstrates that the combination of UV-A LED light (350-385 nm), which is not hazardous to human eyes and skin, and ferulic acid (FA), a known phytochemical and food additive, provides synergistic antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogenic and spoilage micro-organisms.		

Is there any evidence that UV light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can kill the coronavirus?		
Conceptually, UV-C light-emitting diodes (LEDs) overcome many drawbacks of low-pressure mercury tube based UV devices, and UV-A or visible light LEDs also show potential.		

Does the evidence provided support the claim that lighting a Diya or candle can kill Coronavirus?		
The focus is on studies that assessed the effectiveness of ultraviolet (UV) light devices, hydrogen peroxide systems, and self-disinfecting surfaces to reduce healthcare-associated infections (HAIs).		

Can lighting a Diya or candle be used as a disinfectant to kill the coronavirus on surfaces?		
The COVID-19 virus may survive on surfaces for several hours, but simple disinfectants can kill it.		

Does the heat from a lit Diya or candle have the ability to kill the Coronavirus?		
One such claim that has been doing the rounds says burning candles will produce heat and thus, raise the temperature and kill coronavirus.

962,"Covid virus is now ""gone"" in South Korea because residents stayed at home for three weeks.","What measures did South Korea implement to control the spread of COVID-19, despite not having stringent national social distancing measures?		
Background After experiencing a sharp growth in COVID-19 cases early in the pandemic, South Korea rapidly controlled transmission while implementing less stringent national social distancing measures than countries in Europe and the US.		

What public health measures were implemented by South Korea to contain the spread of COVID-19, according to the evidence provided?		
So far, Korea’s disease prevention efforts have worked effectively. When 28 cases were confirmed, South Korea had tested a total of 7,519 people for the COVID-19 as of February 15, 2020.4 Based on the outstanding mass-diagnosis performance of the RT-PCR kits, South Korea public health authorities could implement public health emergency policies that had successfully contained the community spread of COVID-19.		

Did the number of new Covid-19 cases in South Korea decrease after residents stayed at home for three weeks?		
While South Korea experienced a sharp growth in COVID-19 cases early in the global pandemic, it has since rapidly reduced rates of infection and now maintains low numbers of daily new cases.		

What was the main factor that contributed to the decline in Covid-19 cases in South Korea?		
Cases in South Korea spiked initially. However, it swiftly developed a test for the virus - and has now tested more than 290,000 people.		

What factors contributed to the low number of confirmed cases in South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong?		
South Korea is not unique in claiming some success in its fight against the virus. Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, informed by past outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Mers, have managed to keep confirmed cases low while eschewing the sort of draconian measures implemented in mainland China.		

Did the residents of South Korea stay at home for three weeks to control the spread of the Covid virus?		
The posts claim the virus is now ""gone"" in South Korea because residents stayed at home for three weeks and that the epidemic has been “controlled” in Japan.		

What measures did the South Korean government take to control the spread of COVID-19?		
In South Korea, the government adopted proactive and ramped-up testing for COVID-19. It focused on identifying infection hotspots, conducting a large number of tests on at-risk people without charge, disinfecting streets in areas with high numbers of infections, setting up drive-through testing centers, and promoting social distancing.		

What measures did the Korean government take to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 virus in South Korea?		
South Korea and Covid-19. After news of the coronavirus outbreak began to emerge from Wuhan, China, earlier this year, the Korean government activated a 24/7 emergency response system to screen all travelers entering the country from that city.

963,"Alcohol weakens the immune system, making it difficult for the body to fight infections such as Covid-19.","Does excessive alcohol consumption have a negative impact on the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off infections such as Covid-19?		
Excessive alcohol consumption has deleterious effects on the immune system. Several clinical and experimental studies have suggested that long-term alcohol use can lead to the dysregulation of both cell-mediated and humoral immunity (Barve et al. 2002).		

Does moderate alcohol consumption have a beneficial impact on the immune system compared to alcohol abuse or abstinence?		
Since moderate alcohol consumption has been suggested to have a beneficial impact on the immune system compared to alcohol abuse or abstinenceReference Cohen, Tyrrell, Russell, Jarvis and Smith8–Reference Romeo, Warnberg, Díaz, González-Gross and Marcos12, the link between alcohol consumption, immune response, as well as infectious and inflammatory processes remains controversial and not yet completely understood.		

Does excessive alcohol consumption impair the body's ability to fight off infections such as COVID-19?		
Alcohol can directly suppress various immune responses, and clinical studies have found alcohol abuse to be associated with an increased incidence of a number of infectious diseasesReference Ahmed2, Reference Szabo3.		

Is there an association between excessive alcohol consumption and susceptibility to infections such as pneumonia?		
“Clinicians have long observed an association between excessive alcohol consumption and adverse immune-related effects such as susceptibility to pneumonia,” noted a 2015 article, Alcohol and The Immune System, published in Alcohol Research: Current Reviews.		

Does moderate alcohol consumption have a different effect on the immune system compared to chronic heavy drinking?		
In the case of the immune system, moderate alcohol consumption is associated with reduced inflammation and improved responses to vaccination, while chronic heavy drinking is associated with a decreased frequency of lymphocytes and increased risk of both bacterial and viral infections.		

Does moderate and excessive alcohol consumption have an impact on the immune system, potentially making it harder for the body to fight infections like COVID-19?		
In general, severe chronic alcoholics are considered immunocompromised hosts. Although moderate alcohol use has less obvious clinical effects on the immune system, both in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that even moderate amounts of alcohol and binge drinking modulate host immune responses.		

Does moderate alcohol consumption have a beneficial impact on the immune system compared to alcohol abuse or abstinence?		
Experimental and clinical data support the conclusion that alcohol is a potent immunomodulator. While high alcohol consumption suppresses a wide range of immune responses, leading to an increased incidence of a number of infectious diseases, moderate alcohol consumption may have a beneficial impact on the immune system, compared to alcohol abuse or abstinence, most likely due to the multiple components of polyphenol-rich alcoholic contributing to the protective effect seen for moderate alcohol consumption on CVD and the immune system.		

Does moderate alcohol consumption have an effect on the incidence of colds and other infections?		
A study exploring the impact of alcohol consumption on the incidence of colds among 391 subjects intentionally exposed to 5 different respiratory viruses showed that moderate alcohol consumption (i.e., 1 to 2 drinks/day) was associated with decreased incidence of colds in nonsmokers (Cohen et al. 1993).		

Does high-dose alcohol consumption directly suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19?		
Scientists have long debated the effects of alcohol on immune function, showing on the one hand, that high doses of alcohol consumption can directly suppress a wide range of immune responses, and that alcohol abuse is associated with an increased incidence of a number of infectious diseases.		

Does moderate alcohol intake have an effect on the immune system, particularly in relation to fighting off infections?		
In humans, a moderate intake of alcohol in individuals exposed to rhinoviruses was associated with a decreased risk of developing the common cold, suggesting that moderate consumption of alcohol may enhance the immune response, resulting in a more effective host defenceReference Cohen, Tyrrell, Russell, Jarvis and Smith8.

The claim is misleading: the World Health Organization (WHO), radiation experts, and health authorities have said there is no evidence that radiation emitted from 5G is harmful to human health.		

Is there a conclusive link between cell phone and 5G radiation and an increased risk of death from coronavirus?		
Cell phone equipment does emit radiation but research on its health effects has been inconsistent. According to the National Cancer Institute, ""A limited number of studies have shown some evidence of statistical association of cell phone use and brain tumor risks… but most studies have found no association.""		

Is there any evidence that cell phones and 5G towers have a causal link to human deaths?		
According to WHO, From all evidence accumulated so far, no adverse short- or long-term health effects have been shown to occur from the RF signals produced by base stations (cell phone towers).”		

Do the scientific organizations mentioned in the evidence support the claim that radiation from cell phones and 5G towers is currently killing people?		
Following numerous scientific studies conducted over several decades, the FCC, the FDA, the World Health Organization, the American Cancer Society and numerous other international and U.S. organizations and health experts continue to say that the scientific evidence shows no known health risk to humans due to the RF energy emitted by antennas and cellphones.		

Is there evidence that cell phone and 5G tower radiation is linked to human mortality, specifically death from coronavirus?		
Although most scientific and public attention on the issue of the safety of cell phone radiation has focused on evidence suggesting an increased risk of brain tumors (Baan 2011), a little-noticed but growing body of research points to a new concern – sperm damage (La Vignera 2012).		

Is there a correlation between cell phone and 5G tower radiation and cancer or other health issues?		
The safety of cell towers continues to be hotly debated. According to the American Cancer Society, there is no direct correlation between cancer and the radiofrequency waves (RF) from cell towers at this time.

From a week ago on March 11, 2020. The International Commission on Non‐Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), a German-based scientific organization that determines the impact of electromagnetic waves on people and the environment, said March 11 that there is no evidence that 5G networks pose a health risk to humans, The Financial Times reported.		

Does the available research provide conclusive evidence that cell phone and 5G tower radiation is associated with an increased risk of death?		
Research has been done on the effects of cell radiation but it has been inconsistent. According to the National Cancer Institute, ""A limited number of studies have shown some evidence of statistical association of cell phone use and brain tumor risks, but most studies have found no association.""		

Is there any evidence that links 5G or cell phone radiation to the cause of death in people who have contracted the coronavirus?		
The main implication of the claim—that 5G can impact immune systems—is totally unfounded. There is no evidence linking the new coronavirus to 5G.		

Does the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection believe that 5G poses a health threat?		
In the latest scientific study, from the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection – an organization that the WHO specifically refers to on its website with regard to overall RF frequency-related health matters – they concluded that health-related concerns for 5G overall are not a threat.

Seasonal workers are not well represented in the survey on which Table 3 is based, but a separate survey from the National Farmers Union (NFU) has estimated that 99% of seasonal agricultural labour is provided by EU workers (ONS, 2018)—although these figures may overstate the share of EU workers because they only include those sourced through agencies.		

What proportion of employees in the UK's agricultural sector are A8 workers?		
Moreover, despite agriculture comprising less than 1% of UK jobs, “ data suggests that up to a quarter of all employees in this sector in 2011 could have been A8 workers”, underscoring the key role that these workers play in agriculture despite overarching market conditions (McCollum et al., 2012).		

What percentage of the British workforce in the agriculture sector is comprised of EU-born workers, including seasonal workers?		
As a sector, farming has a large interest in what happens to the UK’s access to migrant labour. Across all industries, EU-born workers account for just 5% of the country’s workforce, but in agriculture it’s 65%, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures – not including seasonal workers.		

What percentage of seasonal agricultural workers in Britain are from the EU?		
The National Farmers Union (NFU) Seasonal Supply of Labour survey, which only looks at seasonal agricultural workers recruited by labour providers, estimates that 99% of seasonal labour is provided by EU workers.

British farms have been struggling to find enough seasonal workers since the June 2016 referendum, as EU citizens previously attracted to such work shun the UK for more attractive opportunities elsewhere.		

Is there a shortage of seasonal farm workers in the UK that could be filled by British people?		
In the UK, some farming leaders have called for a “land army” of workers to replace a shortfall of workers that could reach 80,000, according to one estimate, if the 60,000 seasonal workers recruited from abroad in normal years are prevented from coming, and if some British workers fall ill.		

What percentage of seasonal workers in British farms are UK-born?		
That is not an isolated case: according to the National Farmers' Union, less than one per cent of seasonal workers in British farms are UK-born – a drop in the ocean of workers from Romania, Bulgaria and the so-called EU8 countries.		

What percentage of seasonal farm workers in the UK are British nationals?		
In reality, just one percent of seasonal farm workers are UK natives. The latest NFU data suggests there could be as few as 300 British strawberry pickers.		

Why are British nationals showing less interest in seasonal agricultural work in the UK?		
- “An ongoing decline in interest among UK-nationals in employment within the agriculture sector in the UK and a devaluing of seasonal agricultural work, with the loss of a ‘picking culture’ among British nationals.”		

What is the number of British-born workers among the seasonal farm workers in the UK?		
Britain. The National Farmers Union says that there are fewer than 1,000 British-born workers among the 60,000 to 75,000 seasonal farm workers in the UK; most of the non-UK born are from Bulgaria and Romania.

Overall, comparing with the base case where nobody is wearing masks, the probability that the virus is transmitted in the scenario that everybody is wearing masks is reduced to 50% x 50% x 50% = 12.5%.		

What are the estimated probabilities of COVID-19 transmission between a carrier and a non-carrier under different mask-wearing scenarios?		
This study 1) illustrates transmission routes of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); 2) addresses controversies surrounding the mask from perspectives of attitude, effectiveness, and necessity of wearing the mask with evidence that the use of mask would effectively interrupt the transmission of infectious diseases in both hospital settings and community settings; and 3) provides suggestion that the public should wear the mask during COVID-19 pandemic according to local context.		

How effective are masks in reducing the probability of contagion between a COVID-19 carrier and a non-carrier?

What is the effectiveness of wearing a mask in preventing the transmission of COVID-19?		
In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19 transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with many potentially infectious people.		

Did the research examine the effectiveness of masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19, or the effectiveness of mask mandates in reducing the spread of COVID-19?		
This is false; the research examined the effectiveness of mask mandates, not masks, finding that state-issued orders requiring face coverings were linked to a decreased growth rate in Covid-19 cases and deaths, and a CDC spokeswoman said masks are very effective against the deadly illness.		

How does wearing a mask affect the distance that COVID-19 droplets and aerosols travel when a carrier is speaking?		
When someone is speaking, wearing a face mask can slash the distance that droplets and aerosols travel by half (or more, depending on the type of mask), a recent study published in The Journal of Infectious Diseases suggests.		

What is the relationship between mask-wearing and the probability of COVID-19 contagion based on the study's findings?		
Among the volunteers, 43% exhaled large influenza-containing particles while not wearing a mask, compared to 11% while wearing a mask; 92% exhaled small influenza-containing particles while not wearing a mask, compared to 78% while wearing a mask.
