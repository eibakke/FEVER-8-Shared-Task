A number of reports released in recent weeks by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) have revealed growing concerns about non-declared chemical weapons (CW) activities in Syria, raising the prospect that Syria might be hiding illicit CW capabilities in violation of its accession to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).		

What is the OPCW's stance on the methodology of investigations into chemical weapons use?		
The Syria issue also overshadowed the CWC conference of states-parties late last year. A joint declaration tabled by Belarus eschewed attributing any responsibility for chemical weapons use to the Syrian government and, in effect, questioned the integrity of the FFM and the JIM investigation methodology by stating, “Investigations of the use of chemical weapons, conducted by the OPCW, should be professional and be based on objective and thoroughly verified evidence.

Do the media reports of chemical attacks in Syria match the findings of the UN-OPCW Joint Investigative Mechanism?

Has the OPCW identified the perpetrators of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic?		
The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons’ (OPCW), which is made up of Member States, voted by a margin of 82 in favor and 24 against – “to identify the perpetrators of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic”, where the Fact-Finding Mission in the country has decided that weapons have been used, or are likely to have been used.

He actually said, maybe we should detonate a nuclear bomb over the Atlantic. By the way, the same stable genius who said the biggest problem we had in the Revolutionary War is we didn’t have enough airports.","Did Donald Trump suggest using nuclear bombs to stop hurricanes from hitting the U.S.?		
President Donald Trump has denied a report that he proposed using nuclear bombs to stop hurricanes from hitting the U.S., but if he did suggest nuking hurricanes, he isn’t the first.		

Did Donald Trump express skepticism about the severity of climate change?		
However, Trump has repeatedly called climate change a ""hoax"" in speeches, tweets and media appearances, and while he hasn’t necessarily repeated the charge that China ""invented"" climate change, he has said as recently as Jan. 18, 2016, that action on climate change ""is done for the benefit of China.""		

Did Donald Trump originate the idea of using a nuclear bomb to counteract convection currents in hurricanes?		
The big picture: Trump didn't invent this idea. The notion that detonating a nuclear bomb over the eye of a hurricane could be used to counteract convection currents dates to the Eisenhower era, when it was floated by a government scientist.		

Has a sitting US president previously suggested detonating a nuclear bomb over the Atlantic to affect hurricanes?		
The idea of bombing hurricanes is prevalent enough that NOAA has a fact sheet on the concept. This may be the first time in recent American history, however, that a sitting president has suggested the idea.		

How many times has Donald Trump referred to climate change as a hoax?		
However, over the years Trump hasn't shied away from his skepticism about climate change, and he has referred to it as a hoax many times.		

What has Donald Trump said about the concept of global warming?		
Donald Trump's stated views on global warming have changed over the past seven years or so (we'll leave it to pundits to judge whether they've ""evolved"" or ""devolved"" in that time), as exemplified, on the one hand, by his endorsement of a 2009 letter urging the U.S. government to invest in a ""clean energy economy"" and pass legislation addressing the ""immediate challenge"" of climate change, and, on the other, by his November 2012 tweet stating that ""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.""		

Did Donald Trump's views on climate change change after the evidence presented in the statement?		
U.S. President Donald Trump is backing off his claim that climate change is a hoax but says he doesn't know if humans are causing global warming, and he suggests that the climate will ""change back again.""		

Does Trump's suggestion of detonating a nuclear bomb over the Atlantic to mitigate hurricanes imply that he believes climate change is real?		
But his claims would make no sense if climate change was a hoax or simply a byproduct of changes in the weather, arguments that Trump has made in the past.		

Did Donald Trump express skepticism about the projections in the recently released climate report from the United Nations?		
In response to a recently released climate report from the United Nations, Trump said he does not think climate change is a ""hoax"" but he also cast doubt on some of the projections and even alluded that climate scientists are politically motivated.		

What did Donald Trump say about climate change, and what actions did he take regarding the Paris Climate Agreement?		
Donald Trump, on the other hand, has called climate change “a hoax invented by the Chinese,” and withdrawn from the Paris Climate Agreement.

Early messaging from health experts likely contributed to this misconception as health officials, including the U.S. Surgeon General, communicated that masks were not necessary for the general public’s protection.2 Guidance has since changed, as it is estimated that over 40% of people who have the virus are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic spreaders and are likely unaware of their infectious potential.3, 4		

Did the U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams advise against the general public wearing face masks to prevent COVID-19?		
U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams had initially advised against the general public wearing face masks, saying they were ""not effective"" in preventing people from contracting COVID-19 and amplified the risk of health-care providers being unable to get them.		

What was the stance of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus as of March 28, 2020?		
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also consistently advised the public not to use face masks unless sick or caring for someone sick and denied that any updated mask guidance was scheduled as of March 28, 2020 [ ].		

Did the Surgeon General and the CDC previously recommend against wearing masks to protect against coronavirus?		
Asked by NPR about the Surgeon General's earlier tweet about the ineffectiveness of masks, the office of the Surgeon General issued a statement Thursday noting that back in February Dr. Adams was following the CDC, WHO and other health organizations, which all recommended against wearing masks as a way to protect the person wearing them.		

What did the U.S. Surgeon General say about the effectiveness of masks in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus?		
The United States in particular has struggled with face mask guidelines. In early March 2020, the US Surgeon General issued a strongly worded tweet indicating that members of the public should not purchase masks in response to the spread of COVID-19, suggesting both that masks would be ineffective and that they are needed by health care providers [].		

Did the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control previously advise against wearing masks to prevent the general public from catching coronavirus?		
Despite growing evidence on the value of masking and calls for public use of masks as part of a broader strategy that also includes social distancing and hand washing [, ], recent commentary suggests that public guidance on masks may be inconsistent across nations [ ], and the World Health Organization (WHO) maintains, as of May 2020, that masks are only needed for healthy individuals when they are taking care of someone with suspected COVID-19 [ ].		

What is the current stance of the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control on the effectiveness of masks in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus?		
Public health experts unanimously agree that masks help slow the spread of Covid-19. The CDC and World Health Organization both released recommendations to the public to wear masks when social distancing is not possible.		

Did the U.S. surgeon general recommend people wear masks to protect against the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease in February and March 2020?		
U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams made comments in February and March 2020 recommending people not wear masks to help protect against the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, and those comments began to recirculate online in April and May.		

Did the CDC, the World Health Organization, and the U.S. surgeon general recommend against the general public wearing masks to prevent catching coronavirus?		
""Initially, the CDC, the World Health Organization, and my office recommended against the general public wearing masks based on the best available science at the time, in terms of whether or not it prevented the wearer from catching coronavirus,"" Adams said on ""Good Morning America.""		

How have the views of health officials in the U.S. changed regarding the effectiveness of masks in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus?

Proponents of border fences point to the substantial reduction in apprehensions along the San Diego sector as tangible proof that fences succeed in reducing cross-border smuggling and migration where they are constructed.100 Opponents attribute part of the decrease in apprehensions to the increase in manpower and resources in the sector and, pointing to the increase in apprehensions in less-populated sectors, contend that the fence only succeeds in re-routing unauthorized migration and not in stopping it.101		

Does the deployment of barriers in the US have a significant impact on reducing illegal drug, border crossings, and human smuggling activities?		
Published research on the effectiveness of border barriers is limited and offers conflicting results in terms of how much of a role barriers play in deterring unauthorized entry in the U.S.		

Does the evidence suggest that barriers are effective in reducing the number of unauthorized border crossings?		
Border barriers can discourage unauthorized border crossings, but the research is mixed in terms of how much they deter migrants from entering the U.S. without permission.		

What is the relationship between the deployment of barriers in the El Paso Sector and the observed decrease in drug and smuggling activities?		
- El Paso Sector has experienced a significant reduction in drug and smuggling activities in areas where the new border wall system was built.

16,The plentiful evidence we have indicates that masks would not meaningfully help with aerosol transmission of COVID 19.,"Can wearing a face mask be effective in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 if people do not comply with wearing them or if it leads to increased contact due to a false sense of security?		
Even though there is now significant agreement in the medical literature that respiratory transmission of COVID-19 is the dominant vector (Meyerowitz et al. 2020), and many clinical studies have shown that face masks reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and similar illnesses (Chu et al. 2020, Prather et al. 2020, Leung et al. 2020, Greenhalgh et al. 2020), a face mask mandate may not be effective in practice if it fails to increase the prevalence of mask wearing (compliance), or if it leads to increased contact due to a false sense of security.		

Does the available evidence suggest that N95 masks are more effective than surgical masks in preventing the transmission of COVID-19?		
Although surgical masks have lower filtration efficiency than N95 respirators, observational studies have shown no significant benefit of N95 masks over surgical masks for prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (odds ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.22-3.33) or other respiratory viruses (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.85-1.08).3 For health care workers, routine care for a patient with COVID-19 if both are wearing surgical masks is not considered to be a high-risk occupational exposure.3 Yet, SARS-CoV-2 viral particles have been identified in the air for several hours after an aerosolizing event simulated in a laboratory and near air vents in a clinical setting.3 A group of 239 scientists recently signed an open letter urging the World Health Organization and other international public health bodies to recommend additional precautions (though not N95 masks specifically) to protect against potential airborne transmission, highlighting several recent superspreading events in which SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurred in poorly ventilated areas.5 These instances raise concern for the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission; however, the viability and infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in aerosol form remains unknown.		

Does the evidence suggest that masks are effective in reducing the transmission of COVID-19?		
However, a recent study in patients with seasonal coronaviruses has demonstrated that surgical face masks significantly reduced detection of viral RNA in aerosols and shows a trend in reducing viral RNA in droplets.4 A recent meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials also showed that surgical masks are as effective as N95 masks in reducing transmission of influenza‐like diseases.6 If the result from a case–control study during the SARS‐CoV‐1 outbreak in Hong Kong is any indication, frequent masks use (mainly surgical) in public places can be protective by 64%.7		

Do surgical face masks and masks made of dense cotton fabrics effectively prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 into the environment through the coughing of patients with COVID-19?		
The answer is highly relevant to guide public behaviour (Leung et al., 2020). One study suggests that a surgical face mask and masks made of dense cotton fabrics apparently cannot effectively prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 into the environment through the coughing of patients with COVID-19 (Bae et al., 2020; Klompas, Morris, Sinclair, Pearson, & Shenoy, 2020).		

Do the results of studies that support the hypothesis that face masks are effective in reducing the presence of viral particles in droplets and aerosol generated by symptomatic SARS-CoV-2–infected individuals contradict the claim that masks would not meaningfully help with aerosol transmission of COVID-19?		
[9]. The need for universal use of cloth face coverings or, when available, of surgical masks seems further suggested by the results of some studies that support the hypothesis that face masks are effective in reducing the presence of viral particles in droplets and aerosol generated by symptomatic SARS-CoV-2–infected individuals [10].		

Does the evidence suggest that masks are effective in reducing the transmission of COVID-19?		
The use of face masks can be effective at reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-21, 2. Theoretical studies show that the extent of disease outbreaks is dependent on population compliance with mask usage and effectiveness of the masks at reducing viral transmission3.		

Does the evidence from the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine support the claim that masks would not meaningfully help with aerosol transmission of COVID-19?		
Limited, indirect evidence from lab studies suggests that homemade fabric masks may capture large respiratory droplets, but there is no evidence they impede the transmission of aerosols implicated in the spread of COVID-19, according to a paper published yesterday by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.		

Can face masks prevent the transmission of COVID-19?		
Another study, “Respiratory virus shedding in exhaled breath and efficacy of face masks”, published in Nature Research on 3 April, found that face masks could prevent the transmission of human coronaviruses by filtering respiratory droplets.		

According to the National Academies of Sciences Rapid Expert Consultation on the Effectiveness of Fabric Masks for the COVID-19 Pandemic (NAS 2020), what does the evidence suggest about the effectiveness of fabric masks in reducing the transmission of COVID-19?

Does the use of surgical masks prevent the transmission of COVID-19?		
Importantly, no documented SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks have been linked to settings in which surgical masks were assiduously used in lieu of N95 masks, which suggests that even if airborne transmission is a considerable contributor to SARS-CoV-2 transmission, surgical masks are likely sufficient to prevent it.3 Because the infectious dose of virus required to cause clinical infection also remains unknown, it is possible that blocking most, even if not all, viral particles through masks with lower filtration efficiencies of submicron particles is sufficient to prevent disease in the vast majority of cases.

33,"America went from 75,000 flu deaths last year in 2019 to almost 0 in 2020","What was the estimated number of flu-related deaths in the United States during the 2019-2020 flu season?		
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the flu was responsible for an estimated 38,000 deaths in the United States alone during the 2016-2017 flu season, and an even greater number were hospitalized with the illness.		

Did the number of flu deaths in the US decrease in 2020 compared to the previous year?		
During the same period, flu accounted for an estimated 24,000 to 62,000 deaths in the country. The overall dynamic of the 2019-2020 flu season is comparable to previous years, with the exception of a sharper than usual drop in cases in April.		

How many flu-related deaths were reported in the US during week 15 of 2020?		
During week 15 of 2020, 380 flu-related deaths, not zero, were reported. The trajectory of deaths during the 2019-2020 flu season is similar to the curves in previous years, with the possible exception of the 2017-2018 season, which was particularly deadly (Figure 2).		

What was the number of flu deaths in America in 2020 compared to the previous year?		
The flu season was particularly severe last year, meaning the drop in influenza deaths from 2019 to 2020 is even more pronounced.		

What was the estimated number of flu deaths in the United States during the 2019-2020 influenza season, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)?		
Preliminary data suggests there were an estimated 24,000-62,000 flu deaths for the 2019-20 influenza season, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).		

How many flu deaths were there in America in the 2018-2019 flu season?		
From October 2018 to May 2019 the FluSurv-NET data accounted for about 7,000 influenza-associated deaths, which CDC ultimately used to estimate 34,200 total deaths for the 2018-2019 flu season.		

Did the number of flu deaths in the US in 2020 actually decrease compared to the previous year, according to the evidence provided?		
Based on the figure of approximately 60 000 COVID-19 deaths in the US as of the end of April 2020, this ratio suggests only a 1.0-fold to 2.6-fold change from the CDC-estimated seasonal influenza deaths calculated during the previous 7 full seasons.3 From our analysis, we infer that either the CDC’s annual estimates substantially overstate the actual number of deaths caused by influenza or that the current number of COVID-19 counted deaths substantially understates the actual number of deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2, or both.		

Why did the number of flu cases and deaths in the US decrease significantly in 2020 compared to 2019?		
FULL CLAIM: “Flu cases down by 95%” between 2019 and 2020 for the weeks 40 to 41; “COVID-19 cured the flu”; flu is being diagnosed as COVID-19, leading to fewer flu cases being recorded		

What is the basis for the claim that America went from 75,000 flu deaths last year in 2019 to almost 0 in 2020, given that clinical laboratories did record cases of flu and flu-related deaths during the 2019-2020 season?

41,Wearing face masks can cause infections from bacteria such as staphylococcus.,"Does wearing face masks increase the risk of staph infections?		
Based on our research, the claim that face masks cause staph infections is FALSE. Numerous dermatologists have confirmed that face masks do not cause staph infections, and are no more likely to lead to an abrasion on the skin that could allow bacteria to enter than any other clothing.		

Do researchers believe that improper use and discarding of used and contaminated face masks can lead to the spread of infections?		
These conclusions led researchers to speculate that antibacterial masks could be an effective way to reduce secondary transmission of infections, a concern surrounding improper use and irresponsible discarding of used and contaminated face masks.		

What areas of the body are face masks intended to reduce bacterial shedding from?		
Background: Surgical masks (SMs) are used to reduce bacterial shedding from the mouth, nose and face.		

Can wearing face masks lead to bacterial infections such as staphylococcus?		
Efficacy of face masks and respirators in preventing upper respiratory tract bacterial colonization and co-infection in hospital healthcare workers - authors' reply.		

Can wearing face masks, when not used correctly, lead to wound infections?		
Face masks are thought to make wound infections after surgery less likely. However, incorrectly worn masks may increase the likelihood of the wound getting contaminated with germs.		

Does wearing face masks prevent the spread of bacterial infections?		
New research suggests that antibacterial face masks may potentially stop secondary transmission of bacterial infections.		

Does wearing a face mask increase the risk of transmitting a bacterial infection?		
While one well-cited study showed that face masks decreased growth in agar plates placed 30 cm in front of anesthesiologists who talked for several minutes, the same study showed increased bacterial growth once the masks had been worn for 15 minutes when compared to wearing no mask at all.13 Since anesthesiologists rarely change their masks during a procedure (and may use the same mask for the entire day), the mask may increase the risk of transmitting a bacterial infection.		

Does wearing face masks reduce the transmission of bacteria to patients' wounds?		
The practice of wearing face masks is believed to minimize the transmission of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal bacteria from operating theatre staff to patients' wounds, thereby decreasing the likelihood of postoperative surgical site infections.		

What can happen if face masks are worn incorrectly?		
Wearing masks incorrectly may increase the risk of transmission [41]. Further studies of face mask use are now underway, including some with prospective designs that follow cohorts of initially uninfected people.		

Does wearing face masks have any effect on the risk of infection?		
Previous studies on the use of face masks by healthy people in the community have considered other respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-1, influenza, or influenza-like illness (ILI), and have provided some weak evidence that face masks may reduce the risk of infection, particularly when implemented early, combined with hand hygiene and subject to good levels of compliance26–35.

43,Donald Trump said that $15 an hour is too much for essential workers,"Did Donald Trump previously believe that wages were too high?		
Donald Trump said Tuesday he would support raising the federal minimum wage to $10 an hour, a departure from his previous assertion that wages are “too high.”		

What is Donald Trump's stance on the $15 minimum wage?		
A $15 minimum wage would increase wages for over 33 million U.S. workers and lift 1.3 million people out of poverty—nearly half of them children.82 However, days before the passage of the Raise the Wage Act, the administration issued a Statement of Administration Policy recommending that President Trump veto the bill if it reaches his desk.83		

Did the Congressional Budget Office estimate that raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour would result in 1.3 million workers losing their jobs?		
Biden disagreed that a higher minimum wage would lead to companies going out of business. Studies on the topic remain mixed; the Congressional Budget Office estimated in July 2019 that 1.3 million workers would be out of a job if the federal minimum wage was raised to $15 an hour, but other studies have disputed this outcome.		

Did Donald Trump express an opinion on the proposed $15 an hour minimum wage?		
President Donald Trump and Joe Biden differed sharply on the question of a national minimum wage. Trump argued that the minimum wage should be left to the states, and Biden backed a nationwide $15 minimum wage.

44,Deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at “pox parties” could be a good way to help create herd immunity against COVID-19 without a vaccine.,"Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a recommended method for achieving herd immunity against COVID-19?		
Herd immunity for COVID-19 through natural infection can pose many challenges. COVID-19 can cause serious complications and millions of deaths, therefore the experts recommend trying to achieve herd immunity through vaccination.		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a recommended method for creating herd immunity against COVID-19?		
Herd immunity against COVID-19 should be achieved by protecting people through vaccination, not by exposing them to the pathogen that causes the disease.		

According to the World Health Organization, what is the recommended method for achieving herd immunity against COVID-19?		
WHO supports achieving 'herd immunity' through vaccination, not by allowing a disease to spread through any segment of the population, as this would result in unnecessary cases and deaths.		

Is deliberately infecting children with COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a viable alternative to vaccination for achieving herd immunity?		
A vaccine for the virus that causes COVID-19 would be an ideal approach to achieving herd immunity. Vaccines create immunity without causing illness or resulting complications.		

Is the World Health Organization in agreement with the idea of deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" to create herd immunity?		
However, according to the World Health Organization, “Attempts to reach herd immunity through exposing people to a virus are scientifically problematic and morally unethical.”		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at “pox parties” supported by the scientific evidence as a method to create herd immunity against COVID-19?		
Herd immunity, which occurs when enough people become immune to a contagious disease to make further spread unlikely, is a ""dangerous fallacy unsupported by the scientific evidence,"" the scientists wrote.		

Can deliberately infecting children at ""pox parties"" be an effective way to create herd immunity against COVID-19?		
It is currently unclear how herd immunity could happen for COVID-19. For example, the data are insufficient to show how much immunity infection confers, or whether it’s enough to prevent re-infection.		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a scientifically supported method for creating herd immunity against COVID-19?		
Managing COVID-19 by allowing herd immunity to develop in low-risk populations while protecting the most vulnerable is ""a dangerous fallacy unsupported by the scientific evidence,"" warn an international group of 80 researchers in an open letter.		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at “pox parties” a scientifically sound strategy to address COVID-19?		
""Natural herd immunity is not a scientifically sound or humane strategy to address COVID-19,"" she said.		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a viable method for creating herd immunity against COVID-19 without a vaccine?		
Achieving natural immunity, an unfavorable outcome by any measure, would mean exposing susceptible groups to a debilitating and potentially fatal disease—meaning more people could die in the process of achieving herd immunity.

45,Cutting the umbilical cord straight away deliberately denies the baby natural immunity so that medical professionals have a reason to vaccinate and medicate them.,"Does the World Health Organization recommend delayed umbilical cord clamping?		
Despite the available evidence that delayed umbilical cord clamping is more beneficial to infants, as well as the existence of 2014 WHO recommendation that the umbilical cord should be clamped between 1 and 3 minutes, its implementation is still low in many countries including Tanzania.		

Does cutting the umbilical cord immediately after birth cause harm to the baby?		
It has now been shown to provide no benefit to the mother and to result in harm to the neonate. The clinical trial evidence relating to delayed cord clamping compared to immediate cord clamping is presented and the physiological rationale for delayed cord clamping is discussed in this paper.		

Has the recommended timing of umbilical cord clamping been changed from immediate clamping to delayed clamping?		
However, those protocols have since been revised to recommend delayed umbilical cord clamping (1). Thus, analysis of the timing of umbilical cord clamping in relation to postpartum haemorrhage is considered important.		

Does delayed umbilical cord clamping provide any benefits to the baby?		
However, the authors concluded that given the benefit of delayed umbilical cord clamping in term infants, delayed cord clamping is beneficial overall, provided that the obstetrician–gynecologist or other obstetric care provider has the ability to monitor and treat jaundice.		

Does immediate umbilical cord clamping have any benefits for the baby's health?		
Term and preterm infants appear to derive benefit from delayed umbilical cord clamping; therefore, delayed umbilical cord clamping for at least 30–60 seconds is recommended in term and preterm infants except when immediate umbilical cord clamping is necessary because of neonatal or maternal indications.		

Does delaying the clamping of the umbilical cord increase the baby's iron stores and haemoglobin concentrations?		
A more liberal approach to delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in healthy term infants appears to be warranted, particularly in light of growing evidence that delayed cord clamping increases early haemoglobin concentrations and iron stores in infants.		

Do some cultures delay cutting the umbilical cord?		
Delayed umbilical cord clamping is not a modern concept, as some primitive cultures reportedly wait until well after delivery of the placenta before cutting the umbilical cord.		

What is the recommended timing for clamping and cutting the umbilical cord according to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)?		
Recommendations for when to clamp and cut the cord differ. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) advises waiting 30 to 60 seconds after the birth of a preterm infant, but acknowledges there is insufficient evidence to support delayed cord clamping in full-term infants born in areas that do not lack resources.		

What is the current understanding of the optimal timing for umbilical cord clamping in newborns, and what are the implications for their natural immunity and subsequent medical treatment?		
Although many randomized controlled trials that involved term and preterm infants have compared the benefits of delayed umbilical clamping with those of immediate cord clamping, the ideal timing for umbilical cord clamping in specific circumstances warrants further investigation.		

What is the concern about the universal implementation of delayed umbilical cord clamping?		
The universal implementation of delayed umbilical cord clamping has raised concern. Delay in umbilical cord clamping may delay timely resuscitation efforts, if needed, especially in preterm infants.

46,The umbilical cord should not be cut until 1 hour after birth or they baby will not have enough blood right after birth.,"What are the benefits and risks of delayed cord clamping after birth?		
Delayed cord clamping, defined as waiting to clamp the umbilical cord for one to three minutes after birth or until cord pulsation has ceased, is associated with benefits in term infants, including higher birth weight, higher hemoglobin concentration, improved iron stores at six months, and improved respiratory transition.35 Benefits are even greater with preterm infants.36 However, delayed cord clamping is associated with an increase in jaundice requiring phototherapy.35 Delayed cord clamping is indicated with all deliveries unless urgent resuscitation is needed.		

Is it recommended to delay cutting the umbilical cord after birth?		
Delaying cord clamping for at least 30–60 seconds after delivery is recommended by national and international organizations.1–6 In term newborns, delayed cord clamping has been shown to increase blood volume,7		

What is the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommendation for the timing of umbilical cord clamping after birth?

What is the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommendation regarding the timing of umbilical cord clamping after birth?		
Delayed cord clamping appears to be helpful for both full-term and preterm babies. For this reason, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends delayed cord clamping for at least 30 to 60 seconds after birth for most babies.		

Does the World Health Organization recommend waiting at least 1 minute after birth to cut the umbilical cord?		
Despite the available evidence that delayed umbilical cord clamping is more beneficial to infants, as well as the existence of 2014 WHO recommendation that the umbilical cord should be clamped between 1 and 3 minutes, its implementation is still low in many countries including Tanzania.		

Is it recommended to delay cutting the umbilical cord after birth for at least 30-60 seconds?		
Term and preterm infants appear to derive benefit from delayed umbilical cord clamping; therefore, delayed umbilical cord clamping for at least 30–60 seconds is recommended in term and preterm infants except when immediate umbilical cord clamping is necessary because of neonatal or maternal indications.		

What was the standard practice for umbilical cord clamping before 1960?		
Until 1960, delayed umbilical cord clamping (DCC) to promote placental transfusion was common; afterward, cord clamping immediately after birth became standard practice to reduce the risk of postpartum hemorrhage, although without evidence (1, 2).		

What is the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' recommendation regarding the timing of umbilical cord clamping after birth?		
The ACOG does not endorse the practice of delayed cord clamping but rather suggests cord clamping should take place between 30 to 60 seconds after birth, since the ideal timing for cord clamping has yet to be established.		

Does delaying the clamping of the umbilical cord after birth increase the infant's blood volume?		
Traditionally, practitioners have clamped the umbilical cord immediately after birth. Previous studies have shown that delaying cord clamping results in a 20 to 30 percent increase in an infant’s blood volume.		

Does the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend delaying umbilical cord clamping for full-term infants?		
ACOG guidelines only recommend delaying umbilical cord clamping for preterm deliveries, citing a lack of evidence to support the benefits of DCC in full-term infants.

Research has shown health risks associated with 3G and 4G cell phones but there is very little public information about the health effects of higher frequency 5G. Scientists, however, have called for pausing the 5G rollout until more independent research is conducted.		

Does the available scientific evidence support the claim that 5G technology is safe for human exposure?		
In its 2018 review, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority concluded that ""despite the lack of established mechanism[s] for affecting health with weak radio wave exposure there is however need for more research covering the novel frequency domains, used for 5G."" In August 2019, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced that the commission proposes to maintain its current RF exposure safety standards (adopted in 1996), quoting a statement from the Director of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health that ""[t]he available scientific evidence to date does not support adverse health effects in humans due to exposures at or under the current limits.""

There may be adverse health effects from the use of 5G wireless technology, but not enough research has been done to verify that it’s safe, according to health experts.

Although Foster admitted that research on the effects of long-term exposure to 5G millimeter waves was lacking, he restated the FDA’s position that ""[t]he available scientific evidence to date does not support adverse health effects in humans due to exposures at or under the current limits.”		

Do public health scholars believe that the radio frequencies emitted by 5G antennas are safe?

Previous studies of excess deaths (the gap between observed and expected deaths) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic found that publicly reported COVID-19 deaths underestimated the full death toll, which includes documented and undocumented deaths from the virus and non–COVID-19 deaths caused by disruptions from the pandemic.1,2 A previous analysis found that COVID-19 was cited in only 65% of excess deaths in the first weeks of the pandemic (March-April 2020); deaths from non–COVID-19 causes (eg, Alzheimer disease, diabetes, heart disease) increased sharply in 5 states with the most COVID-19 deaths.1 This study updates through August 1, 2020, the estimate of excess deaths and explores temporal relationships with state reopenings (lifting of coronavirus restrictions).

What types of deaths are being suggested to be misclassified or indirectly caused by the pandemic in the claim about US lockdowns?		
Finally, estimates of excess deaths attributed to COVID-19 might underestimate the actual number directly attributable to COVID-19, because deaths from other causes might represent misclassified COVID-19–related deaths or deaths indirectly caused by the pandemic.		

What does the concept of ""excess deaths"" refer to in the context of COVID-19?		
- Measuring excess deaths allows us to understand the full impact of COVID-19 on mortality, including deaths indirectly related to COVID-19.		

Did the reported Covid-19 mortality figures in the US accurately reflect the actual number of deaths in 2020?		
There are reports of excess mortality in some countries during the Covid-19 pandemic. Rivera et al. (2020) found that Covid-19 mortality figures in the US underestimate the actual death toll, and that Covid-19 mortality is likely to be twice as high as reported.

At some time before the Civil War, Grant himself owned a slave named William Jones.

Did Ulysses S. Grant personally own slaves during his lifetime?		
As a result, Ulysses Grant was the last U.S. president to have owned an enslaved individual.

Did Ulysses S. Grant purchase a slave named Jones from his father-in-law?		
How, when, and why Grant obtained a slave are all unknown, although Grant’s mentioning of Frederick Dent suggests that he most likely purchased Jones from his Father-in-law (Grant also had a brother-in-law named Frederick Dent who was serving with the U.S. Army in the western frontier at this time.		

Did Ulysses S. Grant actually own slaves, according to the historical record?

135,No one lost their health care because of the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill.,"Did the Iowa legislators approve a plan that allows Wellmark to sell health insurance policies that do not comply with Affordable Care Act regulations or state rules?		
The Iowa situation became even more complicated this spring, when Iowa legislators approved a controversial plan to let Wellmark partner with the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation to sell 2019 policies that don’t comply with Affordable Care Act regulations or state rules.		

What are some of the indications that the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill may not comply with the federal Affordable Care Act?		
The bill was merged last week with another proposal that would allow the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation to work with Wellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield to sell health insurance plans that don't comply with the federal Affordable Care Act to its own members.		

Does the Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill classify as insurance under the Affordable Care Act?		
The Iowa Farm Bureau partnered with Wellmark (Blue Cross) on a new self-funded benefit plan. The state’s legislation requires that the health plan be sponsored by a local nonprofit agriculture organization and explicitly defines the plan as “not insurance,” exempting the plan from most state insurance regulation as well as regulation required under the ACA.		

Did the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill lead to an increase in health care premiums in Iowa?

137,it is unknown whether a person under 20 can pass the disease to an older adult.,"Is there an age gradient in terms of transmission risk from children to adults?		
There is new evidence, including from a recent comprehensive study from South Korea, suggesting there is an age gradient in terms of transmission risk from children, meaning younger children (<10 years old) are less likely to transmit compared to adults, while older children (10 and older) may transmit at levels similar to adults.		

Can people under 20 years old transmit COVID-19 to older adults?		
Although children and young adults are reportedly at lower risk for severe disease and death from infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), than are persons in other age groups (1), younger persons can experience infection and subsequently transmit infection to those at higher risk for severe illness (2–4).		

Does the lower susceptibility of children to SARS-CoV-2 infection imply that they are unable to pass the disease to older adults?		
Preliminary evidence suggests that children have a lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with adults, but the role that children and adolescents play in transmission of this virus remains unclear.		

Can children under 20 years old transmit the disease to adults?		
Without a doubt transmission from child-to-child and child-to-adult can occur, but a number of studies find children, particularly young children, are less likely to be source of infection in households and other settings, compared to adults.		

Do epidemiological and modeling studies suggest that older children are more likely to drive transmission of the disease to other age groups?		
Epidemiological and modeling studies of transmission focused on households and daycare centers suggest that toddlers and older children, rather than infants, drive transmission in the population (11–14).		

Can people under the age of 20 potentially pass the disease to older adults, despite being at a lower risk of infection themselves?		
Evidence so far indicates that children are at a lower risk of infection, present with milder symptoms, and are much less likely to die from the infection compared to older adults, but they still could present a risk to others in their household, especially in households with people at higher risk, such as older adults and others with pre-existing conditions.		

Is it possible for a person under 20 to pass COVID-19 to an older adult?		
Therefore, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from children is plausible. Considering the relatively low frequency of infected children, even in severely affected areas, biological or other unknown factors could lead to the lower transmission in this population.		

Can a person under 20 years old pass the COVID-19 disease to an older adult?		
There is now extensive literature on household transmission involving children 28 , 31 , 37 , 54 and these reported that children were less susceptible to COVID‐19 than adults at home.		

Can people under the age of 20 transmit the disease to older adults?		
Given the role of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission (2), all persons, including young adults, should take extra precautions to avoid transmission to family and community members who are older or who have underlying medical conditions.		

Is it more or less likely for a person under 20 to transmit the disease to an older adult compared to an adult of the same age?		
There is some evidence for an age gradient in infectiousness, with younger children less likely and older children more likely to transmit at levels similar to adults.

139,A campaign ad video for John Cornyn says that his plan would guarantee insurers must sell plans to any patient with preexisting conditions and will be covered in his plan.,"How does John Cornyn's plan compare to the current Republican legislative proposal regarding coverage for pre-existing conditions?		
- Issue: A current Republican legislative proposal would permit insurers to offer plans that exclude coverage of treatment for preexisting health conditions, even while the bill would maintain the Affordable Care Act’s rule prohibiting denial of coverage to people with a preexisting condition.		

What specific health conditions would be covered under John Cornyn's plan?		
While the Ensuring Coverage for Patients with Pre-Existing Conditions Act maintains the ACA’s provisions that require insurers to enroll individuals with preexisting conditions, the proposed bill would not require that the conditions themselves be covered.		

Does John Cornyn's plan align with the views of the majority of Americans regarding pre-existing conditions?		
A majority of Americans favor retaining the provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that prohibit insurers from denying coverage or charging more to people with preexisting health conditions.1 In fact, a proposed Senate bill, the Republican-backed Ensuring Coverage for Patients with Pre-Existing Conditions Act, would maintain certain provisions under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that prevent insurers from refusing coverage to people or varying premiums based on whether they have a preexisting condition.2		

How does John Cornyn's plan differ from the Affordable Care Act in terms of coverage for pre-existing conditions?		
However, in contrast with the ACA, the proposed legislation would permit insurers to sell plans that entirely exclude coverage for treatment of an enrolled individual’s preexisting condition (Exhibit 1).3 Prior to the ACA’s implementation in 2014, plans sold in the individual market often incorporated such coverage exclusions.4		

How would John Cornyn's plan protect patients with pre-existing conditions?		
This bill would prevent insurers from refusing or varying premiums based on preexisting conditions. But, unlike the ACA, this bill would allow insurers to sell plans that entirely exclude coverage for care pertaining to the preexisting conditions themselves.		

Does John Cornyn's plan offer the same level of protection as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for people with pre-existing conditions?		
Republicans in Congress have suggested legislation that would protect those with pre-existing conditions, but those bills have not offered the same, groundbreaking level of protection Obamacare provides: that a patient's current health could not be considered by insurance companies doling out plans, so people are not charged more or denied care because of their health.		

Does John Cornyn's plan guarantee that insurers must sell plans to any patient with pre-existing conditions at the same price as those without pre-existing conditions?		
Similar to the House-passed bill (the American Health Care Act), the Cassidy-Graham bill would provide states expansive waiver authority to eliminate or weaken the prohibition against insurance companies charging higher premiums based on their health status and the requirement that insurers cover the essential health benefits related to any health insurance plan that is in any way subsidized by the bill’s block grant funding.		

Does John Cornyn's plan guarantee that insurers must sell plans to any patient with pre-existing conditions as stated in his campaign ad video?		
- Eliminate or weaken protections for people with pre-existing conditions by allowing states to waive the ACA’s prohibition against charging higher premiums based on health status and the requirement that insurers cover essential health benefits including mental health, substance abuse treatment, and maternity care.		

Does John Cornyn's plan guarantee that people with pre-existing conditions will not be charged higher premiums?		
Unfortunately, their approach to addressing the needs of people with pre-existing conditions is modeled on one that has failed in several state efforts in recent decades: The new law includes an outright ban on insurers' excluding pre-existing conditions from coverage, and on insurers' requiring people with higher health risks to pay higher premiums (older enrollees would still pay more than younger ones, up to a point).		

Does John Cornyn's plan guarantee that insurers must sell plans to any patient with pre-existing conditions?		
Providing comprehensive protections to people with pre-existing conditions, as the ACA does, requires outlawing a variety of insurance practices that were common before the law took full effect in 2014, including:

Though Trump says he would do this, his administration has consistently taken steps to undermine the Affordable Care Act – including joining a lawsuit aimed at striking down the law – without presenting alternative plans that would offer similar benefits.

Does the Trump administration's plan to broaden alternative coverage options, such as short-term health policies, align with their claim to protect pre-existing conditions for every American?

192,It makes no sense for oil to be cheaper in Nigeria than in Saudi Arabia.,"How much does it cost to produce a barrel of oil in Canada?		
Meanwhile, the location and size of Saudi's oil fields also help keep its production costs down. While it's not the cheapest in the world, as several nations have production costs around $2 per barrel, it's still a fraction of the production costs of a country like Canada, which pays $11.56 to produce a barrel of oil.		

Why does the president think it makes no sense for oil to be cheaper in Nigeria than in other oil-producing nations?		
The president compared the oil price in Nigeria to those of neighbouring countries, arguing that it makes no sense for oil to be cheaper in Nigeria than it is in other oil-producing nations.		

What are the estimated average production costs of oil in Nigeria?		
For example, clearly Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf producers earn substantial economic rents from their oil production as it costs only a few dollars per barrel (average production costs of Saudi oil have been estimated at about $1.50/barrel) to produce oil.		

What is the relationship between the quality of oil exports and the price of oil in Saudi Arabia?		
Indicators suggest that the quality of Saudi Arabia’s exports remains relatively low. This is unsurprising given that crude oil dominates the export basket and oil exports have grown strongly (the measure of export quality is closely tied to the oil price, with a correlation of 0.9 since 2001).		

Why does Saudi Arabia have the lowest oil production costs in the world?		
Saudi Arabia has the lowest oil production costs in the world thanks to two strategic advantages: Abundant pools of oil close to the surface and no taxes on production.		

What is the relationship between oil prices and the fiscal health of countries like Nigeria and Saudi Arabia?		
How does price volatility affect the stability of countries whose fiscal health is tied to oil prices (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Russia, or Nigeria, which have high fuel subsidies and/or are major oil exporters)?		

What is the relationship between Saudi Arabia's production costs and the global oil prices?		
But, because Saudi Arabia's production costs are the lowest in the world, lower prices can hit other producers harder.		

How does the recent collapse in oil prices due to Covid-19 affect the cost of fuel in Nigeria compared to Saudi Arabia?		
However, the recent collapse in oil prices because of Covid-19 means that imported fuel no longer needs to be subsidised and should no longer be a barrier to Nigeria adopting higher standards.		

What factors have influenced the growth of oil production in Saudi Arabia?		
Growth of oil production in Saudi Arabia has been determined largely by exogenous factors connected with the growth of world demand for oil and fluctuations in supplies from other producing areas.		

What led to the lower oil prices in Nigeria in 2019?		
However, lower oil prices led to some reforms in 2019, including a lower tax burden. International oil majors involved in Algerian oil production include BP, Total, and Exxon Mobile.

What is the purpose of the E-6B Mercury planes that were deployed?		
- The Boeing E-4B ""Nightwatch"" and the Navy's E-6B ""Mercury"" planes are built to allow the president to direct US forces in the event of a nuclear war.		

Why were the E-6B Mercury planes deployed?		
This led to the decision to replace both types with one multimission aircraft, the E-6B. As well as serving as ABNCP, the E-6B serves as a backup and communications relay for the four Boeing E-4B National Airborne Command Center aircraft (based on Boeing 747-200 airframes), which entered service in the 1980s.		

What is the relationship between the E-6B Mercury planes and US President Trump's COVID-19 test?		
Between 1997 and 2006, the Pentagon upgraded the entire E-6A fleet to the dual-role E-6B, which expanded the Mercury’s capabilities by allowing it to serve as an Airborne Nuclear Command Post with its own battle staff area for the job.		

What role would the E-6B Mercury planes play in the event of a national emergency, such as a presidential incapacitation due to illness?		
The E-4B is the aircraft that in case of nuclear war would be the airborne command post for the president of the United States, the secretary of defense, and other high government officials.		

What type of aircraft was likely included in the request for information (RFI) due to its capability?		
The Boeing 707-derived E-6B Mercury, or the Take Charge And Move Out, belongs to the U.S. Navy, and is likely included on the RFI because of its capability.

236,"Covid 19 Will Go Away If You Stop Getting Tested, It's Just The Elderly Dying and People Are Being Intentionally Infected","How does the claim that COVID-19 will go away if people stop getting tested relate to the evidence that testing, particularly of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals, is key to interrupting the spread of COVID-19?		
Therefore, COVID-19 can spread quickly in these communities, and the impact of that spread is great. Testing, particularly of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals, is key to interrupting this spread.		

Did Donald Trump suggest that COVID-19 testing should be slowed down?		
Similarly, despite public health officials unanimously endorsing the need for widespread COVID-19 testing to contain the spread of the virus, Trump blamed testing itself for the rapidly rising number of COVID-19 cases and stated at a campaign rally that he told officials to “slow the testing down, please.”		

Is the claim that COVID-19 will go away if people stop getting tested supported by the fact that many cases are asymptomatic and not all infected individuals are being detected through testing?		
Considering that a large number of cases are asymptomatic (or present with very mild symptoms) and that testing has not been performed on the entire population, only a fraction of the SARS-CoV-2 infected population is detected, confirmed through a laboratory test, and officially reported as a COVID-19 case.		

Is it true that the elderly are at a higher risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19?		
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic (2). Data from China have indicated that older adults, particularly those with serious underlying health conditions, are at higher risk for severe COVID-19–associated illness and death than are younger persons (3).		

According to the CDC, can people who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmit the virus to others?		
Although scientists and health care professionals continue to study the spread of COVID-19 to learn more about its presentation, transmission and immunity, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that “a significant portion of individuals with [COVID-19] lack symptoms (“asymptomatic”) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (“pre-symptomatic”) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms.”		

Are people who test positive for COVID-19 more likely to die from the disease if they are older?		
While we have much to learn yet about the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2, and the COVID-19 disease it causes, evidence to date suggests that deaths among people who have tested positive for the coronavirus are highest at older ages and near zero for young children.		

Does the claim that COVID-19 will go away if you stop getting tested assume that the infection fatality rate is only among those who are tested and symptomatic?		
The infection fatality rate is the proportion of infected people who will die from COVID-19, including those who do not get tested or become symptomatic.		

Does the claim that COVID-19 will go away if you stop getting tested, it's just the elderly dying and people are being intentionally infected, align with the evidence that comorbidities increase the chances of infection?		
Due to COVID-19 being a relatively new and understudied disease, the data available is limited. However, from the cases that emerged, it was observed that comorbidities increase the chances of infection [7].		

Is the claim that COVID-19 will go away if people stop getting tested supported by the evidence that testing is necessary to identify people who are in need of care and prevent the spread of the virus?		
Testing of all people for SARS-CoV-2, including those who have no symptoms, who show symptoms of infection such as trouble breathing, fever, sore throat or loss of the sense of smell and taste, and who may have been exposed to the virus will help prevent the spread of COVID-19 by identifying people who are in need of care in a timely fashion.		

Is the reported number of Covid-19 cases and deaths accurate, or are there other factors contributing to the reported numbers?		
Miscounting from misdiagnosis or under-reporting of Covid-19-related deaths is avoided. Excess mortality data include ‘collateral damage’ from other health conditions, left untreated if the health system is overwhelmed by Covid-19 cases, or by deliberate actions that prioritise patients with Covid-19 over those with other symptoms.

PAHO was sued in a Miami court by a group of Cuban doctors who had left the program, which has been accused of labour exploitation and even human trafficking, due to the low salaries and precarious conditions to which the Cuban doctors were subjected in Brazil.		

What were the conditions set by Cuba's Health Ministry regarding the participation of Cuban doctors in the 'More Doctors' program?		
Cuba's Health Ministry particularly rejected statements by Bolsonaro questioning the preparation of Cuban doctors and conditioning their permanence in the program to the revalidation of their degrees and individual contracts.		

How has the relationship between the United States and PAHO changed despite Cuba's expulsion from the organization in 1962?		
However, despite Cuba's expulsion from the latter organization in 1962, PAHO has maintained close relations with the island and is virtually the only regional forum in which the United States and Cuba participate.		

Is the United States a member of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our Americas (ALBA)?

What are some of the challenges that Cuba faces in terms of health security?

These concern Cuba's visibility and participation in the broader global health security architecture, the social controls exercised by the state in managing disease threats in Cuban territory, and the resource constraints facing the island-in particular, the effects of the US embargo.

Is Judith Collins' claim that New Zealand is using more coal to generate electricity because of the oil and gas exploration ban supported by the evidence that New Zealand's domestic gas and oil reserves have declined over the past 10 years?		
New Zealand’s domestic gas and oil reserves have declined over the past 10 years, and as a result the amount of primary energy supplied by New Zealand oil has decreased.

The government is providing free laptops to all the students so that they can complete their education and also give exams with the help of the internet","Is the government's provision of free laptops to students sufficient to address the challenges of unequal access to digital tools and connectivity during the COVID-19 pandemic?		
Unequal access to digital tools, connectivity and lack of training has imposed unseen challenges for governments, schools and teachers to engage students in long distance education during the COVID-19 pandemic.		

How are students continuing their education during the coronavirus pandemic?		
- Using remote learning and education resources to mitigate loss of learning: Many countries have turned to distance learning as a means of mitigating for lost time in school (fully online in China, Italy, France, Germany and Saudi Arabia; mobile phones or television in Vietnam, Mongolia).

In fact, the coronavirus has exposed the digital divide that exists in K-12 schools. In response, many urban districts are scrambling to purchase digital learning devices such as Chromebooks and iPads so that students without those technologies are not left behind.		

Is the government's plan to provide free laptops to students sufficient to support students in completing their education during the school closures due to the coronavirus?		
Governments should focus on adopting strategies that support all students through closures – for example, monitoring students most at risk and ensuring students receive printed or online materials on time, with particular attention provided to students with disabilities who may require adapted, accessible material.		

How have the government's efforts to provide free laptops to students been affected by the lack of access to home computers and high-speed internet in many families?

FACT CHECK: While President Trump and Republicans have repeatedly insisted on protecting preexisting conditions, the Trump administration is currently in court seeking to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, which guarantees coverage for Americans with preexisting medical conditions.		

Does Donald Trump's lawsuit aim to remove protections for people with pre-existing conditions?

Does the Trump administration's court filing indicate that they are trying to remove protections for people with pre-existing conditions under the Affordable Care Act?

The Trump administration and some state attorneys general argue that, because of Congress’s recent repeal of the ACA’s individual mandate penalties, the mandate itself is no longer constitutional.5 In the plaintiffs’ view, such a finding should lead the court to declare the entire health law unconstitutional or lead the court to also declare invalid the law’s protections against insurer coverage denials and underwriting of people with preexisting conditions.		

Would Donald Trump's attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act result in higher insurance costs for people with pre-existing conditions?		
Some 20 million Americans could lose their health coverage and protections for people with preexisting health conditions also would be put at risk if the court agrees with the administration in a case that won’t be heard before the fall.		

How does Trump's attempt to dismantle the Affordable Care Act align with the views of the majority of Americans regarding pre-existing conditions?

The White House press office pointed to a list of recent automaker investments. The list included a totally new Toyota-Mazda assembly plant in Huntsville, Ala., (due to open in 2021) as well as expansions at existing facilities, such as General Motors retooling a Michigan plant to make electric vehicles, and Hyundai adding space at its Alabama facility to streamline engine production.		

Did car companies build or expand assembly plants in the United States during the last nine years?		
- Trump falsely said car companies have not built or expanded plants in the U.S. “for decades.” Two new assembly plants were announced and others expanded in the last nine years.		

Have there been any additions to auto assembly plants in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, South Carolina, and other states under Trump's presidency?		
The president’s son also boasted that “auto manufacturers are going back to Michigan,” when in fact there’s been a net loss of three automotive manufacturing plants since the end of 2016, according to the independent Center for Automotive Research.		

Did the rate of new auto assembly plant additions in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, South Carolina, and possibly other states increase under Trump's presidency compared to the period between 2009-2015?		
Looking ahead, Michigan is slated to benefit from increased investment in auto manufacturing. Between 2009-2015, the state is expected to add 60,000 manufacturing jobs, including significant expansion in the auto industry.		

How many new jobs were added in the auto assembly plants across Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, and South Carolina under Trump's administration?		
Trump's release noted specifically the 900 jobs across three Michigan plants over 12 months. “GM said the new jobs are in addition to 3,300 jobs it promised to add in the U.S. as part of its four-year contract with the United Auto Workers union that was signed in 2015.”		

Did the US capture a majority of automaker investments in North America under Trump's presidency?		
While Mexico won more new auto assembly plants (nine) than the United States (four) in that period, the United States captured 75% of all automaker investments in North America between 2009 and the first quarter of this year.		

How does the rate of growth in auto and parts manufacturing jobs compare between the two-plus years under Trump's presidency and Obama's last two years?		
Federal statistics show that jobs in auto and parts manufacturing grew at a slower rate in the two-plus years since Trump took office than in Obama's last two years.		

How many new auto assembly plants were under construction in the United States as of year-end 2016?		
As of year-end 2016, four assembly plants were under construction in North America; three of the four were in Mexico and only one in the United States (by Volvo in South Carolina).

Her confusion is understandable; media outlets often do present ""black lives matter"" and ""all lives matter"" as opposing slogans.		

Did Bubba Watson write a post that says, ""I see signs all over saying black lives matter. I’m just trying to figure out which black lives matter""?		
Watson's representatives did not respond to our requests for clarification, however, several days after this fact check was originally published, the golfer definitively clarified that he did not write the anti-Black Lives Matter screed.		

Did Bubba Watson's post about ""black lives matter"" suggest that he was questioning the importance of all black lives?		
Let her know that people opposed to the Black Lives Matter movement have co-opted the slogan and hashtag ""#AllLivesMatter"" on social media — and it's often used to express straightforwardly racist beliefs.		

What was the distinction that the author of the essay inadvertently conflated in an earlier version?		
A NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR: An earlier version of this essay inadvertently conflated two important distinctions: Black Lives Matter, the organization, vs. Black Lives Matter, the movement.		

What is Bubba Watson questioning about the phrase ""Black Lives Matter""?		
But as some advocates of saying “Black Lives Matter” see it, the organization’s agenda is not the main reason many Christians oppose the expression.		

What did Bubba Watson say in his post about the Black Lives Matter movement?		
""And, there’s only one indisputable reason why that is the case — because I am Black."" Ujiri touched upon the issue of social justice, referring to the Black Lives Matter movement and the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Elijah McClain, all of whom died during incidents with police.		

Did Bubba Watson express support for the Black Lives Matter movement in his post?		
The politically charged nature of the Black Lives Matter debate was evident in a recent sermon at an Oklahoma church, as a white minister named Mike Mazzalango questioned the organization’s agenda and blamed Black Americans for the nation’s abortion problem.		

Is Bubba Watson suggesting that the slogan ""Black Lives Matter"" implies that black lives matter more than others?		
According to Alicia Garza, one of the people who founded the #BlackLivesMatter project, the slogan is not meant to claim that black lives matter more than others.		

What misconception about the Black Lives Matter movement was mentioned in a social media post by PGA star Bubba Watson?		
When I asked Garza about the most common misperception of Black Lives Matter, she pointed to a frequent social-media dig that it is “a gay movement masquerading as a black one.”		

What is the message that Bubba Watson is trying to understand in his post about the slogan ""Black Lives Matter""?		
The slogan “Black Lives Matter” also reflects the movement’s criticism of how criminal justice policies disparately impact African Americans.

This is false; experts agree that while the virus itself is small enough to fit through mask fibers -- as is vape smoke -- masks do help stop the much-larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles, and multiple studies have indicated that masks reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.		

Do face masks help prevent the spread of coronavirus?		
When it comes to controlling the spread of respiratory illnesses, face masks can help. A study from 2008 found that surgical masks were 68 percent effective in blocking the transmission of SARS, while N95 masks (a type of respirator mask that filters airborne particulate matter) were more than 90 percent effective.

What do studies on the effectiveness of masks against the flu and other respiratory viruses suggest about their ability to prevent the spread of the coronavirus?		
Research on masks' effectiveness against the coronavirus is, at best, inconclusive. Most of what we currently know about masks, from N95s to simple cloth barriers, is based on studies of the flu and other respiratory viruses.		

Does the video accurately represent the findings of scientific papers on the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19?

Do face masks made of surgical and dense cotton fabrics effectively prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 into the environment through coughing?		
The answer is highly relevant to guide public behaviour (Leung et al., 2020). One study suggests that a surgical face mask and masks made of dense cotton fabrics apparently cannot effectively prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 into the environment through the coughing of patients with COVID-19 (Bae et al., 2020; Klompas, Morris, Sinclair, Pearson, & Shenoy, 2020).

A YouTube video and social media posts claim a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks shows that they do not help prevent the spread of coronavirus.		

Do face masks help prevent the spread of coronavirus by stopping larger droplets?		
A few studies have considered the filtration efficiency of homemade masks made with different types of fabric;48–51 however, there is no broad consensus regarding their effectiveness in minimizing disease transmission.52,53 Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that masks and other face coverings are effective in stopping larger droplets, which, although fewer in number compared to the smaller droplets and nuclei, constitute a large fraction of the total volume of the ejected respiratory fluid.		

Do face masks help prevent the spread of coronavirus?		
Surgical face masks may therefore be effective against COVID-19 transmission [17-19]. Thus, face masks can probably protect against virus infection by reducing the risk that virus enters the mouth or nose via respiratory droplets or aerosols.		

Do face masks made of a single layer of cloth provide adequate protection against the spread of COVID-19?		
Home-made cloth face masks likely need a minimum of two layers, and preferably three, to prevent the dispersal of viral droplets from the nose and mouth that are associated with the spread of COVID-19, indicates a video case study published online in the journal Thorax.

In 11 states, there are no “Romeo and Juliet” exceptions; anyone who has sex with a person below the minimum age of consent is committing a crime and could, if convicted, be required to register as a sex offender.		

In which states can a 21-year-old have consensual sex with an 11-year-old without being required to register as a sex offender?		
At least 28 states require registration as a sex offender for someone convicted of having consensual sex with another teenager, if the offender was either age 17 or two years older than the other party.		

Under what circumstances can a judge decide not to list an individual on the sex offender registry for engaging in consensual yet illegal sexual relations with a minor?		
Currently, for consensual yet illegal sexual relations between a teenager age 14 to 17 and a partner within 10 years of age, “sexual intercourse” (i.e., vaginal intercourse) does not mandate that the offender to go onto the sex offender registry; rather, the judge has discretion to decide, based on the facts of the case, whether sex offender registration is warranted or unwarranted.		

Can a 21-year-old have sex with a minor under the age of 18 without being listed on the sex registry?		
Under current state law it is a crime to have sex with someone under the age of 18, but judges have a discretionary power to keep teenagers off the sex offenders’ register for having sex with people of a similar age, such as a 17-year-old and an 18-year-old.		

Under what circumstances can a judge decide not to list an offender on the sex registry for voluntary yet illegal sexual relations with a minor?		
Currently, for voluntary yet illegal sexual relations between a teenager age 14 to 17 and a partner within 10 years of age, “sexual intercourse” (i.e., vaginal intercourse) does not mandate that the offender to go onto the sex offender registry; rather, the judge has discretion to decide, based on the facts of the case, whether sex offender registration is warranted or unwarranted.

The Covid-19 pandemic is currently unfolding in “one big wave” with no evidence that it follows seasonal variations common to influenza and other coronaviruses, such as the common cold, the World Health Organization has warned.		

What are the key differences between COVID-19 and the flu that can help distinguish between the two during the cold and flu season?		
COVID-19 and the flu are both respiratory illnesses caused by different viruses. While they share some symptoms like fever, cough and fatigue, COVID-19 causes more symptoms than the flu, including loss of taste or smell, shortness of breath and digestive issues.

The issue of mask wearing has been widely debated in the press and the World Health Organization (WHO) have recently changed their advice, to now recommend the routine wearing of face masks by the general public as a means of preventing the spread of COVID‐19 (WHO, 2020a).		

Does the World Health Organization recommend the use of face masks for protection against Covid-19?		
Despite growing evidence on the value of masking and calls for public use of masks as part of a broader strategy that also includes social distancing and hand washing [, ], recent commentary suggests that public guidance on masks may be inconsistent across nations [ ], and the World Health Organization (WHO) maintains, as of May 2020, that masks are only needed for healthy individuals when they are taking care of someone with suspected COVID-19 [ ].

Even the cautious and consensus-driven World Health Organization, which initially recommended against masks, now encourages their use in areas of widespread COVID-19 transmission137, in light of new information on the disease and the results of large-scale comparative studies135.		

What does the World Health Organization's updated guidance on the use of masks for the control of COVID-19 say about the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19?

What change in advice did the World Health Organization (WHO) make regarding the use of face masks in public?		
The World Health Organization (WHO) has changed its advice on face masks, saying they should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible to help stop the spread of coronavirus.		

Does the World Health Organization have evidence that face masks are effective in reducing the transmission of Covid-19?		
First, the evidence for the effectiveness of face masks in reducing viral transmission is very weak. Few studies examine the use of face masks in community settings; those that do find no evidence of reduced transmission compared with no face masks.(2,3) Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence: both recent systematic reviews cautiously suggest that in some circumstances, wearing of face masks may be warranted.(2,3)		

Has the World Health Organization (WHO) changed its stance on the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19?		
The WHO guidance on face masks for COVID-19 has changed to include the recommendation that the general public use fabric masks in public settings where physical distancing can’t be achieved and provides specific guidance on mask layers and materials.		

What measures, according to the WHO, are necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19 when wearing a face mask?		
The WHO's guidance on the use of medical masks makes clear that their use alone is insufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 without proper hand-washing and other measures to protect against human to human transmission.

446,"US President Trump made vaccines voluntary, not mandatory, in the US.","What authority does the president have to change the vaccination policy in the US?		
Mandating vaccination is a state power, not within the president’s jurisdiction. Trump will also lack the power to directly change the CDC’s recommended vaccination schedule, but he can appoint a new director to the CDC or the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.		

Did the Trump administration change the mandatory nature of vaccines in the US?		
The Trump administration has sought to control vaccine guidance issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) — a customarily apolitical scientific regulator tasked with certifying the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, medications, and other medical treatments and technologies.		

Did the Trump administration initially try to block the implementation of vaccine guidelines in the US?		
The Trump administration later attempted to block the vaccine guidelines but ultimately allowed their implementation after protests from experts and the biotech industry concerned about undermining public trust in the FDA.		

What was the impact of the Trump administration's decision to close down the National Vaccine Program Office on vaccine safety measures in the US?		
The Trump administration’s efforts to politicize and undermine vaccine safety measures are especially damaging given the administration’s 2019 decision to close down the National Vaccine Program Office — a government body tasked with monitoring the safety of vaccines.

Did the US President make COVID-19 vaccines mandatory in the US?		
The claim is false; neither Trump nor the pharmaceutical executive make any reference to a vaccine being ""ready"" for distribution; as of March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) states there is not yet a vaccine for COVID-19.		

Did the US government change the vaccination policy to make vaccines voluntary under the Trump administration?		
of mandatory vaccination or mandates for speciﬁc vaccines. In the latter case, 		

Did US President Trump change the mandatory status of vaccines in the US?		
The challenges facing US vaccine policy and vaccine policymakers are many, all the more so given the past statements of the president about vaccine safety and the tenuous place of science and expertise throughout his administration.		

What role did the Trump administration assign to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the context of vaccine distribution during the pandemic?		
The Trump administration has sought to sideline the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which Trump has repeatedly clashed with during the pandemic, from its usual role in compiling national data on infectious diseases.		

Did US President Trump indicate that a vaccine would be made available to the public without any requirement for mandatory vaccination?		
In September 2020, Trump directly contradicted the director of the C.D.C. by promising that a vaccine would be developed in a matter of weeks and “go to the public immediately” while also casting doubts on the value of wearing masks.

447,A virus can easily pass through a mask.,"Does the use of N95 respirators provide better protection than medical masks against viral respiratory infections?		
Respiratory viruses are primarily transmitted by large droplets. Because a fraction of respiratory viruses may be transmitted by aerosol, N95 respirators have been presumed to provide better protection than medical masks against viral respiratory infections in health care settings.2 However, definitive evidence of greater clinical effectiveness of N95 respirators is lacking.		

Do some surgical masks provide low protection against airborne viruses?		
Some surgical masks may let a significant fraction of airborne viruses penetrate through their filters, providing very low protection against aerosolized infectious agents in the size range of 10 to 80 nm.		

Can surgical masks be effective in preventing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2?		
A previous study reported that surgical masks and N95 masks were equally effective in preventing the dissemination of influenza virus (4), so surgical masks might help prevent transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS–CoV-2).		

Does wearing a surgical mask reduce the transmission of respiratory viruses, including coronaviruses?		
An April study found that surgical masks reduced the transmission of multiple human coronaviruses (though the research did not include this new one, SARS-CoV-2) through both respiratory droplets and smaller aerosols.		

How effective are face masks in preventing the spread of a virus?		
Yes. Face masks reduce the spread of viral respiratory infection. N95 respirators and surgical masks both provide substantial protection (compared with no mask), and surgical masks provide greater protection than cloth masks.		

Can surgical masks prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2?		
Importantly, no documented SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks have been linked to settings in which surgical masks were assiduously used in lieu of N95 masks, which suggests that even if airborne transmission is a considerable contributor to SARS-CoV-2 transmission, surgical masks are likely sufficient to prevent it.3 Because the infectious dose of virus required to cause clinical infection also remains unknown, it is possible that blocking most, even if not all, viral particles through masks with lower filtration efficiencies of submicron particles is sufficient to prevent disease in the vast majority of cases.		

Can a virus be effectively blocked by wearing a surgical mask?		
Surgical masks reduced the overall number of RNA copies by 3.4 fold. These results suggest an important role for aerosols in transmission of influenza virus and that surgical facemasks worn by infected persons are potentially an effective means of limiting the spread of influenza.		

Can a virus pass through a mask?		
Although surgical masks have lower filtration efficiency than N95 respirators, observational studies have shown no significant benefit of N95 masks over surgical masks for prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (odds ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.22-3.33) or other respiratory viruses (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.85-1.08).3 For health care workers, routine care for a patient with COVID-19 if both are wearing surgical masks is not considered to be a high-risk occupational exposure.3 Yet, SARS-CoV-2 viral particles have been identified in the air for several hours after an aerosolizing event simulated in a laboratory and near air vents in a clinical setting.3 A group of 239 scientists recently signed an open letter urging the World Health Organization and other international public health bodies to recommend additional precautions (though not N95 masks specifically) to protect against potential airborne transmission, highlighting several recent superspreading events in which SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurred in poorly ventilated areas.5 These instances raise concern for the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission; however, the viability and infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in aerosol form remains unknown.		

What is the effectiveness of different types of masks in preventing the transmission of respiratory viruses?		
A previous study showed that 2-ply cotton masks are ineffective in preventing respiratory viral infections (RVI) (2), while other studies have demonstrated efficacy of the medical masks in decreasing RVI (3, 4).		

How effective are surgical masks in preventing the passage of viruses?		
A study that is often cited as evidence that surgical masks work is a randomised trial from 2009 that compared surgical masks with a specialist mask called an N95 respirator – a mask that fits snugly and filters at least 95% of very small (0.3 micron) particles.

451,PEDOPHILIA is now LEGAL in CALIFORNIA,"Does the California bill in question make pedophilia legal?		
Contrary to QAnon-fueled claims that a California bill would legalize pedophilia, the bill would actually standardize the rules about who is required to be on the state’s sex offender registry.		

Is the claim that pedophilia is now legal in California accurate?		
He also stood by the claim that the bill would ""protect pedophiles who rape children,"" citing California's age-of-consent law as a reason to ignore the distinction between forcible rape and ""consensual"" sex acts such as those that fall under the heading of statutory rape:		

Has California passed a law that allows judges to waive the sex registration requirement for certain defendants convicted of pedophilia-related crimes?		
Now with the passing of California Senate Bill 145 (2020), judges may waive the sex registration requirement for certain defendants convicted under the following Penal Code subsections if the child was a 14-year-old (or older) and within 10 years of age of the defendant:		

Does the new law in California, SB 145, make pedophilia legal for all individuals, or is it specifically aimed at close-in-age LGBT youth who have consensual sex?		
SB 145 is geared toward close-in-age LGBT youth who have consensual oral sex or anal sex. Opponents of the new law claim it promotes pedophilia and sexual abuse.		

Does the American Psychological Association (APA) support the criminalization of child sexual abuse?		
Pedophilia should not be thought of as an orientation. The APA was correct in supporting a criminal justice component to the serious matter of child sexual abuse.		

Does the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) consider pedophilia a psychiatric condition?		
Given the common misconception that Pedophilia is synonymous with child sexual abuse, DSM-5 has done little to define and characterize a Pedophilic Disorder as a psychiatric condition in its own right, independent of its potential criminal implications.		

Is consent a valid defense in cases of statutory rape in California?		
However, be aware that, unlike in the case of a rape charge, consent is not a defense to statutory rape in California, as statutory rape is based on the belief that those below the legal age of consent cannot give valid consent to sexual activity.		

Does the proposed bill in California aim to remove the exclusion of pedophilia from the definition of sexual orientation?		
A provision of existing law prohibits the term sexual orientation from including pedophilia. This bill would delete the provision related to pedophilia.		

Is pedophilia now legal in California?		
California Penal Code 288 is the state statute that makes it illegal for someone to engage in other types of sexual activity with a minor.

The administration has yet to release a proposal for how the federal government might foster more school choice in states and localities around the country, although its initial budget proposal included additional funding for charters and other forms of public school choice, as well as funding for a new private school choice program.2 Left-leaning policymakers and commentators have raised concerns about whether such policies will help disadvantaged children.

Did President Trump take action to block travel from China before the first case of the coronavirus spread within the United States?		
So while there were reports from China in late December about coronavirus-driven deaths, and the United States banned non-U.S. travelers from China in early February, it took five more weeks until mid-March for President Trump to block European travel to the United States, which accelerated the introduction of coronavirus from New York to northern California.

While the 434-page report by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz also found that the FBI mishandled parts of its application to monitor a Trump campaign aide as it was investigating possible Russian interference, it firmly concluded that the FBI and the Justice Department launched their investigation into Trump's 2016 campaign not for political reasons but because of evidence that the Russian government was using ""cutouts"" to reach out to the Trump campaign as part of its efforts to influence the election.		

Did the Obama-Biden administration conduct any surveillance on the Trump campaign?		
The FBI did conduct legal, court-ordered surveillance of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page as part of the broader Russia investigation that Horowitz determined was justified.		

Did the Obama-Biden administration's surveillance operation on the Trump campaign follow proper procedures?		
The Inspector General report on the Crossfire Hurricane investigation did not find evidence that ""political bias or improper motivation influenced the FBI's decision to seek FISA authority on Carter Page"", but did point out serious inconsistencies and improper procedures that were followed with regard to the obtaining of the warrants.[17]		

Did the Obama-Biden administration obtain a secret warrant to monitor a Trump campaign adviser?		
The document – which Democrats said lacked appropriate context and seemed to be a pretext for conservatives to discredit the investigation into Trump – alleged the FBI misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in obtaining a secret warrant to monitor former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.		

Was the Obama-Biden administration's surveillance operation on the Trump campaign conducted for political purposes?		
No evidence has been found that legal surveillance, as part of Crossfire Hurricane, was at the direction of Obama, Obama administration political officials or improper deep state influence, or that the Steele dossier was used to launch the Russia probe,[12] or that the surveillance was designed to surveil the Trump campaign and Trump White House transition team for political purposes.		

What was the purpose of the FBI's electronic eavesdropping on the Trump campaign, as revealed in the FISA warrants obtained by the Obama-Biden administration?		
Horowitz released his long-awaited report Monday on the FBI’s four applications for the FISA warrants to conduct electronic eavesdropping on Page as part of the bureau’s investigation into potential collusion between the Russian government and members of the Trump campaign.		

Did the FBI's surveillance operation on the Trump campaign occur before or after Carter Page stopped working for the campaign?		
Facts: The FBI’s surveillance was conducted after Page stopped working for the campaign. The OIG review found that certain factual assertions relied upon in the FISA applications were inaccurate, incomplete, or unsupported by appropriate documentation, based upon information the FBI had in its possession at the time the application was filed, and the review uncovered unprofessional conduct by a low-level FBI lawyer.		

What was the subject of the FBI's previously classified foreign surveillance warrant application that was released in 2023?

Declassified documents revealed that the FBI and Justice Department in 2016 used information from the dossier – and other evidence that is still secret – to convince federal judges to approve a foreign surveillance warrant on Page.		

Did the Obama-Biden administration have sufficient evidence to justify launching a surveillance operation on the Trump campaign in July 2016?		
While the pugnaciously partisan Attorney General was quick to endorse the Report’s criticisms of the FISA surveillances approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) as part of that investigation (Barr called it “a clear abuse of the FISA process”), he rejected the inspector general’s conclusion that the FBI had an adequate “predicate” for the decision to launch the investigation into the Trump campaign in July 2016 (saying that the investigation was launched upon “the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken”).[8]
