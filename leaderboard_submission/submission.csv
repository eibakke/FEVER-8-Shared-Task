The number of confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. is estimated to be 377,883 in 2020. This total far exceeds 173,040, the total number of preventable injury death in 2019 (latest official count available).

Early messaging from health experts likely contributed to this misconception as health officials, including the U.S. Surgeon General, communicated that masks were not necessary for the general public’s protection.2 Guidance has since changed, as it is estimated that over 40% of people who have the virus are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic spreaders and are likely unaware of their infectious potential.3, 4		

Did the U.S. Surgeon General initially advise against the general public wearing face masks to prevent COVID-19?		
U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams had initially advised against the general public wearing face masks, saying they were ""not effective"" in preventing people from contracting COVID-19 and amplified the risk of health-care providers being unable to get them.		

Did the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control change their views on the effectiveness of masks in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus?		
Editor's note: Health officials' views on wearing face masks have shifted as the outbreak spreads. On Friday, April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC now recommends Americans wear a ""basic cloth or fabric mask,"" not a medical-grade mask, in public.		

Did the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control previously state that masks are not effective in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus?		
COVID-19 guidelines issued by WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other agencies have been consistent about the need for physical distancing of 1–2 m but conflicting on the issue of respiratory protection with a face mask or a respirator.2 This discrepancy reflects uncertain evidence and no consensus about the transmission mode of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).		

Did the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control previously recommend against wearing masks for the general public during the early stages of the pandemic?		
Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization now recommend cloth masks for the general public, but earlier in the pandemic, both organizations recommended just the opposite.		

Did the Centers for Disease Control recommend wearing face masks to prevent the spread of coronavirus, despite the U.S. surgeon general previously stating that masks are not effective in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus?		
SARS-CoV-2 spreads person-to-person through close contact and despite current guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control recommending face masks, only a third of Americans wear a mask outside.1 With concerningly low rates of the public embracing the recommendation to wear a face mask, patients around the country are showing up at healthcare facilities without masks and some are refusing to wear one.		

Did the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control previously state that cloth masks are ineffective in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus?		
Our review of relevant studies indicates that cloth masks will be ineffective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, whether worn as source control or as PPE.		

Did the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control previously advise against the general public wearing masks to prevent catching coronavirus?		
""Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others,"" the CDC's website says.		

Do the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control still believe that cloth masks are not effective in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus?		
Reasons have included: (1) we don’t truly know that cloth masks (face coverings) are not effective, since the data are so limited, (2) wearing a cloth mask or face covering is better than doing nothing, (3) the article is being used by individuals and groups to support non-mask wearing where mandated and (4) there are now many modeling studies suggesting that cloth masks or face coverings could be effective at flattening the curve and preventing many cases of infection.		

Did the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control previously state that masks are not effective in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus?		
Despite this step, our findings continued to support the ideas not only that masks in general are associated with a large reduction in risk of infection from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV but also that N95 or similar respirators might be associated with a larger degree of protection from viral infection than disposable medical masks or reusable multilayer (12–16-layer) cotton masks.

12,New Zealand’s new Food Bill bans gardening,"Does the Food Safety Minister's statement suggest that the Food Bill does not ban gardening?		
Food Safety Minister Kate Wilkinson says she is concerned that the Green Party is endorsing misinformation about the impacts of a new Food Bill.		

What is the main purpose of the new Food Bill in New Zealand, according to the given information?		
“The new Food Bill is about modernising legislation that is now 30 years old. It is about ensuring that people who sell and prepare food do so safely.		

Does the New Zealand Food Bill have any relation to food labeling claims?		
Nevertheless, in light of the comprehensive regulatory scheme established for food labeling claims by the NLEA, the Commission is issuing this statement to clarify how its own authority relates to issues raised by FDA's food labeling regulations.		

Does the New Zealand Food Commission require food advertisers to establish scientific consensus in support of their claims?		
However, the Commission does not require food advertisers to establish that there is scientific consensus in support of their claims.		

Does the New Zealand's Food Bill have any relation to the regulation of food labeling in the US, as described in the evidence?		
In addition to requiring nutrition information on virtually all food products, the NLEA directed FDA to standardize and limit the terms permitted on labels, and allows only FDA-approved nutrient content claims and health claims to appear on food labels.7 While the NLEA is designed in part to prevent deceptive and misleading claims on labels, Congress also intended that nutrient content and health claims educate consumers in order to assist them in maintaining healthy dietary practices.8 The NLEA also mandated that FDA undertake a consumer education effort to educate consumers about the new food label and the importance of diet to health.9 Therefore, in keeping with its recently expanded and unique jurisdictional mandate, the requirements set forth in FDA's regulations have a broader purpose than preventing false and misleading claims in food labeling.		

Does the Food Bill have any relation to the current election year in New Zealand?		
“For some time anonymous agitators have been spreading false information on the internet regarding the Food Bill and despite initially countering their views, Sue Kedgley has now buckled in order to chase their votes because it is an election year.		

What does the Commission's approach to the regulation of health claims in food advertising have in common with FDA's approach to such claims in labeling?		
The Commission's approach to the regulation of health claims in food advertising and FDA's approach to such claims in labeling therefore share many basic elements.		

Does the New Zealand Food Bill restrict the activities of small growers who share or trade their produce with neighbors or sell directly to consumers?		
“Small growers who share or trade their produce with neighbours or who sell direct to consumers have nothing to fear from the new Food Bill.		

Does New Zealand's new Food Bill require health claims on food products to be adequately substantiated and presented in a truthful manner?		
The Commission shares the concerns underlying the NLEA, and embodied in FDA's regulations, that health claims be adequately substantiated and presented in a manner that is truthful and not misleading.		

Does the New Zealand Food Bill ban gardening?		
Instead, this statement focuses on the general issues that are likely to remain relevant to the Commission's regulation of food advertising over time, as specific provisions in the FDA regulations are amended.

Does the evidence from previous epidemics and observational data support the effectiveness of wearing face masks in reducing the spread of COVID-19?		
Although no studies have examined SARS-CoV-2 transmission directly, data from previous epidemics (6,7) support the use of universal face coverings as a policy to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as does observational data for COVID-19 in an analysis of 194 countries that found a negative association between duration of a face mask or respirator policy and per-capita coronavirus-related mortality; in countries that did not recommend face masks and respirators, the per-capita coronavirus-related mortality increased each week by 54.3% after the index case, compared with 8.0% in those countries with masking policies (CT Leffler, Virginia Commonwealth University, unpublished data, 2020).§ Similar outcomes have been observed for other respiratory virus outbreaks, including the 2002–04 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (6) and the 2007–08 influenza season (7).		

Do face masks have a proven role in preventing the spread of COVID-19?		
Face masks to prevent transmission of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis		

Does wearing face masks lower the risk of contracting viral respiratory infections, including COVID-19?		
In observational studies, wearing masks is associated with a lower risk of contracting viral respiratory infections.3,4 For example, in a 2011 Cochrane systematic review published by Jefferson et al, the use of masks in case-control studies was associated with an important risk reduction (odds ratio = 0.32; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.39).3 However, the observational design is at high risk of confounding and mask use might simply be a surrogate measure for comparing more careful versus less careful people.		

Does wearing face masks have a significant impact on reducing the transmission of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19?		
Efficacy of face mask in preventing respiratory virus transmission: A systematic review and meta-analysis.		

Do face masks reduce the risk of infection from Covid-19?		
Face masks (surgical type) reduced infection risk by 85%. Since face masks are comparatively cheap and easy to use, they are among the most simple and straight forward means to curb SARS-Cov-2 and Covid-19 transmission (see also [53]).		

Does the evidence from a systematic review and meta-analysis support the claim that wearing face masks will stop the spread of COVID-19?

The CDC failed to reference the National Academies of Sciences Rapid Expert Consultation on the Effectiveness of Fabric Masks for the COVID-19 Pandemic (NAS 2020), which concludes, “The evidence from…laboratory filtration studies suggests that such fabric masks may reduce the transmission of larger respiratory droplets.		

Does wearing a face mask have any effect on the spread of Covid 19?		
Trials are under way to determine if masks can reduce the spread of COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov: and NCT04296643); however, none were published at the time of writing.		

Does wearing a face mask in public places help reduce the spread of COVID-19?		
Face masks are a simple way to help decrease coronavirus transmission and save lives. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wearing a face mask in public places has been shown to reduce the spread of COVID-19, because those who are pre-symptomatic can spread the virus before showing symptoms.

16,The plentiful evidence we have indicates that masks would not meaningfully help with aerosol transmission of COVID 19.,"Do the findings of the 239 scientists contradict the claim that masks would not meaningfully help with aerosol transmission of COVID-19?		
As discussed in an earlier CIDRAP commentary and more recently by Morawska and Milton (2020) in an open letter to WHO signed by 239 scientists, inhalation of small infectious particles is not only biologically plausible, but the epidemiology supports it as an important mode of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.		

Do cloth masks and face coverings have a significant impact on reducing the transmission of COVID-19?		
In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19 transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with many potentially infectious people.

33,"America went from 75,000 flu deaths last year in 2019 to almost 0 in 2020","What were the estimated yearly flu deaths in the US between 2013-2014 and 2018-2019?		
The CDC, like many similar disease control agencies around the world, presents seasonal influenza morbidity and mortality not as raw counts but as calculated estimates based on submitted International Classification of Diseases codes.2 Between 2013-2014 and 2018-2019, the reported yearly estimated influenza deaths ranged from 23 000 to 61 000.3		

What could explain the discrepancy between the reported flu deaths in 2019 and the low reported flu deaths in 2020, given that the number of COVID-19 deaths was relatively low compared to previous years?		
Based on the figure of approximately 60 000 COVID-19 deaths in the US as of the end of April 2020, this ratio suggests only a 1.0-fold to 2.6-fold change from the CDC-estimated seasonal influenza deaths calculated during the previous 7 full seasons.3 From our analysis, we infer that either the CDC’s annual estimates substantially overstate the actual number of deaths caused by influenza or that the current number of COVID-19 counted deaths substantially understates the actual number of deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2, or both.		

How many influenza deaths were reported in the week ending February 29, 2020, compared to the number of COVID-19 deaths reported in the week ending April 11, 2020?		
The CDC also publishes provisional counts of COVID-19 deaths but acknowledges that its reporting lags behind other public data sources.7 For the week ending April 11, 2020, data indicate that the number of provisionally reported COVID-19 deaths was 14.4-fold greater than influenza deaths during the apparent peak week of the current season (week ending February 29, 2020), consistent with the ranges based on CDC statistics.6 As the CDC continues to revise its COVID-19 counts to account for delays in reporting, the ratio of counted COVID-19 deaths to influenza deaths is likely to increase.		

What was the range of flu deaths in the peak week of the influenza season in the US from 2013-2014 to 2019-2020, according to the CDC?		
By contrast, according to the CDC, counted deaths during the peak week of the influenza seasons from 2013-2014 to 2019-2020 ranged from 351 (2015-2016, week 11 of 2016) to 1626 (2017-2018, week 3 of 2018).6		

How many times greater were the COVID-19 deaths in the week ending April 21 compared to the peak week of counted influenza deaths during the past 7 influenza seasons in the US?		
The mean number of counted deaths during the peak week of influenza seasons from 2013-2020 was 752.4 (95% CI, 558.8-946.1).7 These statistics on counted deaths suggest that the number of COVID-19 deaths for the week ending April 21 was 9.5-fold to 44.1-fold greater than the peak week of counted influenza deaths during the past 7 influenza seasons in the US, with a 20.5-fold mean increase (95% CI, 16.3-27.7).5,6		

What was the estimated number of flu deaths in the US in 2019 according to the CDC?		
On average, the CDC estimates of deaths attributed to influenza were nearly 6 times greater than its reported counted numbers.		

Did the number of flu deaths in the US decrease significantly between 2019 and 2020?		
Over that same time period, however, the number of counted influenza deaths was between 3448 and 15 620 yearly.4		

What was the number of flu deaths in the United States in 2020 compared to the previous year?		
Using data available from October 1, 2018, to May 4, 2019, CDC estimates that influenza virus infection has caused 37.4 million–42.9 million symptomatic illnesses; 17.3 million–20.1 million medical visits; 531,000–647,000 hospitalizations; and 36,400–61,200 deaths in the United States.		

How do the differences in reporting requirements for flu and COVID-19 deaths affect the accuracy of influenza death counts?		
Conversely, influenza counts may be less reliable because adult influenza deaths are not reportable to public health authorities, as is the case for COVID-19 deaths.		

How do weekly counts of COVID-19 deaths compare to weekly counts of seasonal influenza deaths in 2020?		
Conversely, COVID-19 fatalities are at present being counted and reported directly, not estimated. As a result, the more valid comparison would be to compare weekly counts of COVID-19 deaths to weekly counts of seasonal influenza deaths.

44,Deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at “pox parties” could be a good way to help create herd immunity against COVID-19 without a vaccine.,"Is the immunity provided by catching chickenpox as a wild virus considered more effective than the immunity achieved by receiving the vaccine?		
Proponents of the Pox Parties believe that chickenpox is a harmless childhood disease and that catching chickenpox as a wild virus will provide better immunity later in life than the immunity achieved by receiving the vaccine.		

Is there a precedent for deliberately exposing children to a virus to create herd immunity?		
“Chickenpox parties” became popular in the 1970’s and 80’s as a way for parents to expose children to the virus at a young age, thereby avoiding any complications associated with contracting the disease later in life.		

Is there a historical precedent for intentionally exposing children to a contagious disease to achieve herd immunity?		
In the past, some parents participated in “chickenpox parties” to intentionally expose their unvaccinated children to a child with chickenpox in hopes that they would get the disease.		

Are some parents choosing to deliberately expose their children to chickenpox instead of getting vaccinated?		
Despite health experts saying the vaccine is highly effective and safe, some parents are still choosing to forgo this method and instead expose children to the chickenpox the old fashioned way — with an infection party.		

Do some parents believe that natural immunity gained from getting a disease is better than vaccination?		
And although the vaccine exists, some parents believe the natural immunity children gain from getting the chickenpox is better than the shot.		

How does identifying individuals without immunity relate to the idea of deliberately infecting children to create herd immunity against COVID-19?		
Identifying persons without evidence of varicella immunity during an outbreak is important for preventing the spread of disease and for protecting those at high risk for severe disease.		

What is the relationship between ""pox parties"" and COVID-19 that is being suggested by the claim?		
“Chickenpox parties”, which were prevalent in the 1970’s and 80’s, have re-emerged among social groups who identify as anti-vaccination.		

What are the potential risks of deliberately infecting children with COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" to create herd immunity?

45,Cutting the umbilical cord straight away deliberately denies the baby natural immunity so that medical professionals have a reason to vaccinate and medicate them.,"What is the current recommended timing for umbilical cord clamping, and how has it changed from previous protocols?		
However, those protocols have since been revised to recommend delayed umbilical cord clamping (1). Thus, analysis of the timing of umbilical cord clamping in relation to postpartum haemorrhage is considered important.		

Is cutting the umbilical cord straight away recommended unless the newborn is experiencing asphyxiation?		
These findings also suggest that immediate cord clamping (ICC) isn’t recommended unless the newborn is asphyxiated and needs immediate resuscitation.		

Is delayed cord clamping a standard practice in full-term births?		
Delayed cord clamping is not standard medical practice in full-term births. The standard of care in obstetrics right now only calls for delayed cord clamping with premature babies who are more in need of the increase in blood volume compared to full-term babies.		

Does waiting to cut the umbilical cord, as recommended by the World Health Organization, have any relation to the claim that cutting it straight away is done to deny babies natural immunity for the purpose of vaccination and medication?		
Although there is much debate surrounding the optimal time to clamp the umbilical cord, WHO’s findings suggest that late cord clamping (one to three minutes after delivery or longer) is recommended for all births.		

Does delaying the clamping of the umbilical cord increase the baby's natural immunity and potentially reduce the need for medical interventions such as vaccinations and medication?		
A more liberal approach to delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in healthy term infants appears to be warranted, particularly in light of growing evidence that delayed cord clamping increases early haemoglobin concentrations and iron stores in infants.		

Does cutting the umbilical cord immediately reduce the risk of certain neonatal complications?		
Immediate cord clamping is considered less risky than DCC because it allows for immediate neonatal care or intervention and reduces the risk of certain neonatal complications.		

Does the World Health Organization recommend delaying the clamping of the umbilical cord to preserve natural immunity in newborns?		
More mothers than ever before are inquiring about delayed cord clamping (DCC). This rise correlates with the World Health Organization’s recommendation that the umbilical cord should not be clamped earlier than necessary.		

Does the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend waiting before cutting the umbilical cord, and if so, for how long?		
Recommendations for when to clamp and cut the cord differ. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) advises waiting 30 to 60 seconds after the birth of a preterm infant, but acknowledges there is insufficient evidence to support delayed cord clamping in full-term infants born in areas that do not lack resources.		

What are the potential risks associated with delaying the cutting of the umbilical cord?		
However, delayed cord clamping does come with some risks and there continues to be significant debate about the risks and benefits of waiting to clamp the umbilical cord.		

Does cutting the umbilical cord immediately after birth have any negative effects on a baby's natural immunity?		
There is growing evidence that delayed cord clamping is beneficial and can improve the infant's iron status for up to 6 months after birth.

What is the recommended minimum time frame for delayed cord clamping after birth, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)?		
Delayed cord clamping appears to be helpful for both full-term and preterm babies. For this reason, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends delayed cord clamping for at least 30 to 60 seconds after birth for most babies.		

What is the recommended time frame for clamping the umbilical cord according to the World Health Organization (WHO)?		
Although there is much debate surrounding the optimal time to clamp the umbilical cord, WHO’s findings suggest that late cord clamping (one to three minutes after delivery or longer) is recommended for all births.		

What is the recommended timing for cord clamping according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)?		
The ACOG does not endorse the practice of delayed cord clamping but rather suggests cord clamping should take place between 30 to 60 seconds after birth, since the ideal timing for cord clamping has yet to be established.		

Is there evidence to support delaying umbilical cord clamping for full-term infants?		
ACOG guidelines only recommend delaying umbilical cord clamping for preterm deliveries, citing a lack of evidence to support the benefits of DCC in full-term infants.		

What is the recommendation of the WHO and ACOG regarding the timing of umbilical cord clamping after birth?		
Research suggests delayed cord clamping is safe and beneficial for you and your baby. Both the WHO and ACOG recommend delayed clamping.		

Is delayed cord clamping a standard practice in full-term births?		
Delayed cord clamping is not standard medical practice in full-term births. The standard of care in obstetrics right now only calls for delayed cord clamping with premature babies who are more in need of the increase in blood volume compared to full-term babies.		

Does delaying the clamping of the umbilical cord increase the amount of blood and iron stores in newborn infants?		
A more liberal approach to delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in healthy term infants appears to be warranted, particularly in light of growing evidence that delayed cord clamping increases early haemoglobin concentrations and iron stores in infants.		

What is the recommended time frame for delayed umbilical cord clamping after birth?		
Delayed umbilical cord clamping is usually performed 25 seconds to 5 minutes after giving birth. DCC allows more blood to transfer from the placenta to the baby, sometimes increasing the child’s blood volume by up to a third.		

What is the recommended time frame for clamping the umbilical cord according to the World Health Organization?		
The WHO recommends that the umbilical cord not be clamped any earlier than is necessary for controlled cord traction, which they say is normally around three minutes.

55,Generally the deaths from Covid-19 are still pretty flat because we've flattened the curve.,"Does the claim that deaths from Covid-19 are still pretty flat because we've flattened the curve account for all COVID-19 related deaths?		
However, it doesn't account for unconfirmed COVID-19 cases or unattributed excess deaths, and therefore carries uncertainties that may not reflect the disease's actual death rate.		

Are the daily numbers of Covid-19 cases and deaths increasing or decreasing?		
If cases and deaths are growing rapidly by the day, the pace of total infections and fatalities over time will have steep upward trajectories, while decreases in daily numbers leads to a flatter line.		

Does the number of new Covid-19 cases show a decrease in the rate of increase, indicating that public health measures have been effective in slowing the spread of the virus?		
If public health measures designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 have an effect, and the number of new cases begins to fall, a plot of total infections over time would become less steep, or flatten.		

What is the relationship between the case fatality rate and the claim that deaths from COVID-19 are still pretty flat?		
The case fatality rate is another key COVID-19 metric. This measure reflects the percentage of confirmed cases that have resulted in a death attributed to the disease.		

How do the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths vary among Wisconsin's 72 counties?		
The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths varies widely among Wisconsin's 72 counties. As the pandemic has continued, daily confirmed case and death counts at the county level accumulate and highlight regional patterns of COVID-19 infections.		

What does the recent trend in daily deaths indicate about the current state of COVID-19 cases?		
Fluctuations in daily deaths are a lagging indicator reflecting a preceding change in cases.		

Is the number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 increasing or decreasing?		
The state reports new confirmed infections and deaths reported on a daily basis. If the number of new confirmed cases rises day to day, that's a sign that the outbreak is growing.		

What does the graph suggest about the trend in COVID-19 deaths in Wisconsin over time?		
This graph tracks the total deaths among confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wisconsin over time. The data points on this graph represent the cumulative total number of deaths reported to public health by the date along the bottom.		

Does the graph show the number of deaths from COVID-19 by the date a death was reported, rather than the actual date of death?		
This graph presents data by the date a death was reported as being associated with COVID-19 (and not by date of death).		

Does the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases accurately represent the total number of COVID-19 infections?		
Widespread testing for COVID-19 provides another metric for understanding the spread of the disease. The total number of confirmed cases in Wisconsin is likely considerably smaller than the true number of infections.

""The weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths,"" says co-author NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. ""		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's 2008 paper state that the majority of 1918-1919 Spanish Influenza pandemic deaths were caused by bacterial pneumonia, and if so, did it attribute this to wearing masks?		
The majority of deaths during the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 were not caused by the influenza virus acting alone, report researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health.		

What was the primary cause of most 1918-1919 Spanish flu deaths, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci's 2008 paper?		
In the most recent influenza pandemic that did not involve the use of antibiotics to suppress bacteria (the 1918–1919 pandemic), histological and bacteriologic evidence suggests that the vast majority of influenza deaths resulted from secondary bacterial pneumonia.		

What was the primary cause of most 1918-1919 Spanish flu deaths, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci's 2008 paper?		
Conclusions: The majority of deaths in the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory-tract bacteria.		

What was the primary cause of most 1918-1919 Spanish flu deaths, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci's 2008 paper?		
Based on contemporary and modern evidence, we conclude here that influenza A virus infection in conjunction with bacterial infection led to most of the deaths during the 1918–1919 pandemic.		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's 2008 paper conclude that the pathogenesis of severe influenza-associated pneumonia in the 1918-1919 Spanish Influenza pandemic was primarily viral or a combination of viral and bacterial agents?		
The question of whether the pathogenesis of severe influenza-associated pneumonia was primarily viral (i.e., assumed to be an unknown etiologic agent in 1918) or a combination of viral and bacterial agents was carefully considered by pathologists in 1918–1919, without definitive resolution [26, 33].		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's 2008 paper find that bacterial pneumonia was a cause of death in the 1918-1919 Spanish Influenza pandemic, and if so, did it attribute this to wearing masks?		
Historical autopsy reports and examination of lung tissue sections from 1918 to 19 influenza case material indicated that for a significant number of patients, the cause of death was not primary viral pneumonia (Brundage and Shanks, 2008; Morens et al., 2008; Chien et al., 2009).		

What was the focus of Dr. Anthony Fauci's 2008 paper regarding the 1918-1919 Spanish Influenza pandemic?		
We examined relevant information from the most recent influenza pandemic that occurred during the era prior to the use of antibiotics, the 1918–1919 “Spanish flu” pandemic.		

What was the primary cause of most 1918-1919 Spanish flu deaths, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci's 2008 paper?		
The majority of deaths in the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory–tract bacteria.		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's 2008 paper find that most 1918-1919 Spanish Influenza pandemic deaths were caused by bacterial pneumonia from wearing masks?		
This is not necessarily indicative of the human situation in 1918, as influenza viruses caused epidemics and pandemics prior to 1918 (Dowdle, 1999; Johnson, 2006; Morens and Fauci, 2007; Morens et al., 2009; Valleron et al., 2010).

Did Dr Anthony Fauci's paper on the 1918 pandemic mention masks as a cause of bacterial pneumonia?		
“We agree completely that bacterial pneumonia played a major role in the mortality of the 1918 pandemic,” says Anthony Fauci, director of National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease in Bethesda, Maryland, and author of another journal article out next month that comes to a similar conclusion.		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's paper on the 1918-1919 Spanish Flu support the claim that bacterial pneumonia was the primary cause of most deaths, or did it suggest that the novel influenza A (H1N1) strain was the main cause of death?		
Many influenza experts, policy makers, and knowledgeable observers believe that a novel influenza A (H1N1) strain directly caused most deaths during the 1918–19 pandemic, often from a hemorrhagic pneumonitis that rapidly progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death (1–3).		

What was the primary cause of most 1918-1919 Spanish flu deaths, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci's paper?		
Conclusions: The majority of deaths in the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory-tract bacteria.		

Did Dr Anthony Fauci's paper on the 1918-1919 Spanish Flu attribute the majority of deaths to bacterial pneumonia caused by wearing masks?		
However, healthcare providers, medical experts, and published data from the 1918 period suggest that most deaths were caused by secondary bacterial pneumonias (5–12); hemorrhagic pneumonitis that rapidly progressed to death was considered an alarming but uncommon clinical manifestation (8,11–13).		

Did Dr Anthony Fauci's paper on the 1918 flu pandemic suggest that bacterial pneumonia was the primary cause of deaths, rather than wearing masks?		
Medical and scientific experts now agree that bacteria, not influenza viruses, were the greatest cause of death during the 1918 flu pandemic.		

Did Dr Anthony Fauci's paper on the 1918 flu pandemic mention facemasks as a cause of bacterial pneumonia?		
Facemasks were a popular preventative measure employed during the 1918 pandemic. While people were unsure of the etiological agent of the pandemic, the consensus was that it was an airborne disease and wearing a facemask would prevent infections (Crosby, 1976).		

What was the primary cause of most 1918-1919 Spanish flu deaths, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci's referenced study?		
Morens et al (2008) found that during the Spanish flu “the majority of deaths … likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory–tract bacteria.”19		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's paper on the Spanish Flu mention masks as a cause of bacterial pneumonia in 1918-1919?		
Moreover, the effectiveness of facemasks in preventing the transmission of influenza virus remains unclear (Cowling et al., 2010) and just as was observed in 1918, low public compliance significantly limits the utility of facemasks in a modern pandemic setting (Cowling et al., 2010).

What percentage of excess deaths in the United States between 1 March and 1 August 2020 were attributed to the coronavirus?		
Mortality rates for causes other than COVID-19 were available only for underlying causes. Death data with any mention of COVID-19 on the death certificate (as an underlying or contributing cause) were used to capture all deaths attributed to the virus.		

In the 14 states where more than 50% of excess deaths were attributed to underlying causes other than COVID-19, what percentage of excess deaths could not be directly attributed to the coronavirus?		
In 14 states, more than 50% of excess deaths were attributed to underlying causes other than COVID-19; these included California (55% of excess deaths) and Texas (64% of excess deaths) (Table).		

Of the excess deaths recorded in the U.S between 1st March and 1st August 2020, what percentage were attributed to COVID-19?

Do the observed increases in mortality from heart disease, diabetes, and other diseases in 2020 suggest that lockdowns may have contributed to excess deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19 in the US?		
Large increases in mortality from heart disease, diabetes, and other diseases were observed. Further investigation is required to determine the extent to which these trends represent nonrespiratory manifestations of COVID-19 or secondary pandemic mortality caused by disruptions in society that diminished or delayed access to health care and the social determinants of health (eg, jobs, income, food security).		

What is the relationship between the number of COVID-19 associated deaths in a state and the proportional increase in deaths from other underlying causes such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease?

88,A man who received four ballot applications votes four times in the 2020 election.,"Is there evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election?		
A Washington Post analysis was able to find only four documented cases of voter fraud in the 2016 election out of 135 million ballots cast.		

Is it possible for a person to vote more than once in an election?		
During the 2018 election, the state found that out of 3.2 million ballots cast, there were 142 cases of voter fraud — where people had either voted more than once or cast a ballot for a deceased family member.		

Is it possible for a person to receive multiple ballot applications and still only vote once in the 2020 election?		
“If someone sent in 10 requests for a mail ballot, they would receive one. In some states, that might even be against the law,” Becker said, adding that each voter has a unique voter ID number that is tied to a single ballot.		

Did the Presidential Commission on Election Integrity find any evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 election?		
The narrative about fraud ultimately resulted in President Trump convening the Presidential Commission on Election Integrity, which disbanded in January 2018 without presenting any evidence or findings.		

Is it possible for a person to vote more than once in the 2020 election?		
A: No. Once a voter casts a ballot, the voter cannot cast another ballot. Attempting to vote more than once in the same election is a felony.		

Are all ballots cast in the 2020 election, including those that are unused, spoiled, or void, counted in determining the results of the election?		
- Although only valid ballots should be counted in determining the results of the election, election officials should account for all ballots cast in the election, including unused, sample, challenged, spoiled, and totally void ballots.		

Can a person who has received multiple ballot applications be identified as having voted in the 2020 election through election records?		
4. Review election records, such as the voter eligibility list and voter register, to determine if the retired members cited by the protesting member and any other retired members actually voted in the election.		

Is it possible for a person to vote more than once in the 2020 election?		
7. Determine how many votes may have been affected if the allegation is true, which in this example would be the total number of retired members who improperly voted in the election.		

Can a person's vote be retrieved and not counted if they try to vote more than once in an election?		
Because absentee ballots and early voting ballots are retrievable, if someone tries to get around the system, their ballot can be retrieved and not counted, so it will not affect the outcome of an election.		

What action will election officials take if a man who received four ballot applications votes four times in the 2020 election?		
In such cases election officials may decide that they do not have to pursue the allegation further. However, in most instances you will probably need to take further action (such as reviewing union records or talking to individuals who can provide necessary information) in order to resolve the protest.

89,"Most deaths in the 1918 influenza pandemic originated from bacterial pneumonia caused by face masks and that Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government’s top expert in the fight against Covid-19, knew about it.","Did Dr. Anthony Fauci state that face masks caused bacterial pneumonia in the 1918 influenza pandemic?		
""The weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths,"" says co-author NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. ""		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci or the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ever claim that face masks caused bacterial pneumonia in the 1918 influenza pandemic?		
The majority of deaths during the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 were not caused by the influenza virus acting alone, report researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health.		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci claim that face masks caused bacterial pneumonia in the 1918 influenza pandemic?		
In the most recent influenza pandemic that did not involve the use of antibiotics to suppress bacteria (the 1918–1919 pandemic), histological and bacteriologic evidence suggests that the vast majority of influenza deaths resulted from secondary bacterial pneumonia.		

Did Dr Anthony Fauci know that the pathogenesis of severe influenza-associated pneumonia in the 1918 pandemic was primarily a combination of viral and bacterial agents?		
The question of whether the pathogenesis of severe influenza-associated pneumonia was primarily viral (i.e., assumed to be an unknown etiologic agent in 1918) or a combination of viral and bacterial agents was carefully considered by pathologists in 1918–1919, without definitive resolution [26, 33].		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci claim that face masks caused bacterial pneumonia in the 1918 influenza pandemic?		
The majority of deaths in the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory–tract bacteria.		

What was the primary cause of most deaths in the 1918 influenza pandemic?		
Although the cause of influenza was disputed in 1918, there was almost universal agreement among experts [e.g., 20, 27–33] that deaths were virtually never caused by the unidentified etiologic agent itself, but resulted directly from severe secondary pneumonia caused by well-known bacterial “pneumopathogens” that colonized the upper respiratory tract (predominantly pneumococci, streptococci, and staphylococci).		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's research suggest that face masks contributed to bacterial pneumonia in the 1918 influenza pandemic?		
Based on contemporary and modern evidence, we conclude here that influenza A virus infection in conjunction with bacterial infection led to most of the deaths during the 1918–1919 pandemic.		

What was the primary cause of most 1918-1919 Spanish flu deaths, according to the published reports?		
The published reports ""clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory flora in most influenza fatalities,"" says Dr. Morens.		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci state that face masks caused bacterial pneumonia in the 1918 influenza pandemic?		
We examined relevant information from the most recent influenza pandemic that occurred during the era prior to the use of antibiotics, the 1918–1919 “Spanish flu” pandemic.		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci state that face masks caused bacterial pneumonia in the 1918 influenza pandemic?		
[20, 30, 32]. The pneumonia deaths during the influenza pandemic in 1918 proved so highly similar, pathologically, to the then-recent pneumonia deaths from the measles epidemics that noted experts considered them to be the result of one newly emerging disease: epidemic bacterial pneumonia precipitated by prevalent respiratory tract agents [20, 33, 63].

At a time when the incidents of rapes of minors have been increasing and there is lack of action against brutes in Haryana, BJP MP and actress Kirron Kher has said that the rape culture in not new in India and has existed for ages.		

Does the claim made by BJP MP Kirron Kher about rape being a part of Indian culture and its inevitability have any basis in scientific research?		
In that case, it may be attractive to refute a claim made in some prestigious journal. The term Proteus phenomenon has been coined to describe this phenomenon of rapidly alternating extreme research claims and extremely opposite refutations [29].		

Does Kirron Kher's statement about rape being a part of Indian culture reflect the uncertainty and unreliability of research findings?

What matters is the totality of the evidence. Diminishing bias through enhanced research standards and curtailing of prejudices may also help.		

Does the evidence provided by the researcher suggest that cultural attitudes towards rape, such as those expressed by BJP MP Kirron Kher, are supported by scientific research?		
Regardless, even in the most stringent research designs, bias seems to be a major problem. For example, there is strong evidence that selective outcome reporting, with manipulation of the outcomes and analyses reported, is a common problem even for randomized trails [25].
