A number of reports released in recent weeks by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) have revealed growing concerns about non-declared chemical weapons (CW) activities in Syria, raising the prospect that Syria might be hiding illicit CW capabilities in violation of its accession to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).

What does the joint declaration by Belarus suggest about the integrity of the OPCW's investigation methodology?		
The Syria issue also overshadowed the CWC conference of states-parties late last year.

Between 130,000 and 210,000 COVID-19 deaths in the United States could have been avoided if the Trump administration had quickly and effectively implemented a cohesive public health response to the novel coronavirus, according to a new report.		

Would a faster COVID response in the US have reduced the death toll?

Would a faster COVID response in the US have reduced the death toll, given the potential for undercounting of COVID-19 deaths?		
Based on the figure of approximately 60 000 COVID-19 deaths in the US as of the end of April 2020, this ratio suggests only a 1.0-fold to 2.6-fold change from the CDC-estimated seasonal influenza deaths calculated during the previous 7 full seasons.3 From our analysis, we infer that either the CDC’s annual estimates substantially overstate the actual number of deaths caused by influenza or that the current number of COVID-19 counted deaths substantially understates the actual number of deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2, or both.		

If the US had acted more responsibly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, how many fewer deaths do researchers estimate would have occurred?

What is the estimated number of excess deaths due to COVID-19, according to the given evidence?		
[50–53]. No matter which method is used, the estimated excess number of deaths, ranging from 286,425 to 333,906, is already greater than the outer margin of what the federal government stated, on April 3, 2020, would be the upper limit of the expected death toll, i.e., 200,000 [54–56].		

If the actual number of COVID-19 deaths in NYC would have been 5,293 fewer than the reported number, how many people would have died in total if the city had acted responsibly?

Would an early implementation of the lockdown have reduced the number of COVID-19 deaths?		
The plots show that an early implementation of the lockdown would have averted about 126,000 COVID-19 cases, 54,700 non-ICU admissions, 15,600 ICU admissions, and 12,800 deaths.		

If the CDC's provisional counts of COVID-19 deaths are revised to account for delays in reporting, what is the expected increase in the ratio of COVID-19 deaths to influenza deaths?		
The CDC also publishes provisional counts of COVID-19 deaths but acknowledges that its reporting lags behind other public data sources.7 For the week ending April 11, 2020, data indicate that the number of provisionally reported COVID-19 deaths was 14.4-fold greater than influenza deaths during the apparent peak week of the current season (week ending February 29, 2020), consistent with the ranges based on CDC statistics.6 As the CDC continues to revise its COVID-19 counts to account for delays in reporting, the ratio of counted COVID-19 deaths to influenza deaths is likely to increase.		

If the COVID-19 pandemic had been controlled, how many fewer deaths would there have been, according to the estimates?

Early messaging from health experts likely contributed to this misconception as health officials, including the U.S. Surgeon General, communicated that masks were not necessary for the general public’s protection.2 Guidance has since changed, as it is estimated that over 40% of people who have the virus are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic spreaders and are likely unaware of their infectious potential.3, 4		

Were face masks effective in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus according to the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control?		
U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams had initially advised against the general public wearing face masks, saying they were ""not effective"" in preventing people from contracting COVID-19 and amplified the risk of health-care providers being unable to get them.		

Did the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control advise the public not to wear face masks to prevent catching coronavirus in March 2020?		
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also consistently advised the public not to use face masks unless sick or caring for someone sick and denied that any updated mask guidance was scheduled as of March 28, 2020 [ ].		

Did the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control previously state that face masks are ineffective in preventing the general public from catching the coronavirus?		
The United States in particular has struggled with face mask guidelines. In early March 2020, the US Surgeon General issued a strongly worded tweet indicating that members of the public should not purchase masks in response to the spread of COVID-19, suggesting both that masks would be ineffective and that they are needed by health care providers [].		

Did the U.S. Surgeon General and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend against wearing masks as a way to protect the general public from catching coronavirus in February?		
Asked by NPR about the Surgeon General's earlier tweet about the ineffectiveness of masks, the office of the Surgeon General issued a statement Thursday noting that back in February Dr. Adams was following the CDC, WHO and other health organizations, which all recommended against wearing masks as a way to protect the person wearing them.		

Did the U.S. Surgeon General recommend that the general public wear masks to protect against COVID-19?		
U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams made comments in February and March 2020 recommending people not wear masks to help protect against the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, and those comments began to recirculate online in April and May.

12,New Zealand’s new Food Bill bans gardening,"What is the origin of the rumor that New Zealand's new Food Bill bans gardening?		
The rumor of New Zealand's purported nationwide ban on personal gardening stemmed from public discussions about Food Bill 160-2[1], which was first introduced by the New Zealand Parliament on May 26th, 2010.		

Does the Food Bill 160-2 imply that home gardening and selling homegrown produce could be restricted?		
In the thread, several participants cited critical and even alarmist interpretations of Food Bill 160-2, a legislative proposal calling for sweeping reforms and amendments to New Zealand's domestic food regulatory regime, many of which implied that the bill could result in severe restrictions on home gardening and selling homegrown produce.		

Does the New Zealand Food Bill 160-2, if fully implemented, allow individuals to grow and share food from their back garden plots or smallholdings?		
Similarly the New Zealand Government are currently trying to push through the Food Bill 160-2 onto their statute books, it has already passed through the first stage of going onto their statute books, once fully implemented it would mean that it would be completely illegal for people to grow and share food from the back garden plot or smallholding and only those involved in agribusiness would have the right to grow and produce food.		

Does the claim that New Zealand’s new Food Bill bans gardening refer to the Food Act 2014?		
The post was in fact referring to a 2010 bill that was passed into law as the Food Act 2014, which specifically excludes ""seeds... or other plant material intended for planting"" from the scope of the legislation.		

Does the Food Bill 160-2 imply that genetic modification of food is not a matter of food safety?		
- At least one New Zealand Minister of Parliament (Steffan Browning) has noted that the ""genetic modification of food"" has been deleted from the first draft of the Food Bill 160-2 as if the Minister for Food Safety is proposing that genetic modification is not a matter of food safety, which is very much as odds with the national opinion (New Zealand) on genetic modification.		

What changes did the Food Act 2014 introduce to New Zealand's domestic food laws?		
The Food Act 2014 introduced some fundamental changes to New Zealand's domestic food 		

Does the Food Act 2014 imply that gardening is considered a high-risk food safety activity?		
The Food Act 2014 focuses on how food is produced – rather than on the premises where it is made. Under the Act, businesses that have a higher food safety risk will operate under more stringent food safety checks than those considered lower risk.		

Does the claim imply that the new Food Bill is a measure taken by the government to address the concern of food safety in New Zealand?		
Food safety in New Zealand is a concern by the general public and the government takes measures to regulate it.		

Does the claim that New Zealand's new Food Bill bans gardening relate to food safety regulations in New Zealand?		
In New Zealand the Ministry of Primary Industries regulates food safety issues. To improve trade and food safety, New Zealand and Australia work together through Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) and other co-operative agreements.		

Does the New Zealand Food Bill restrict the right to grow food?		
New food bill in New Zealand takes away human right to grow food

13,Wearing face masks will stop the spread of covid 19,"Does wearing face masks effectively reduce the airborne transmission of COVID-19?		
Among the most effective preventative behaviors is face mask wearing, which has been extensively supported to reduce airborne transmission of viruses (Leung et al., 2020; O'Dowd et al., 2020); however, many people are resistant to face mask wearing despite the effectiveness of the practice, which poses extreme risks in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic (Howard, 2020; Lyu & Wehby, 2020).		

Does wearing a face mask have a significant effect on reducing the spread of COVID-19?		
Finding out whether face masks indeed reduce the spread of COVID-19 is thus important. Against the available evidence from clinical studies or previous pandemics, we ask: Can we identify a significant effect of face masks on the spread of COVID-19 by looking at the development of registered COVID-19 cases?

Do face masks help prevent the spread of COVID-19 among both the wearer and those around them?		
Face masks, among other measures such as isolation, quarantine, lockdowns, social distancing and vaccination, have been used for prevention in a wide range of disease outbreaks and medical settings, and there is currently a general consensus that surgical and cloth masks help prevent infected individuals from spreading coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).2,3 Surprisingly, given the logic of their utility, there is less of a consensus that surgical/cloth masks also protect the wearer and many government health organizations did not initially recommend wearing them during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.4,5

Does wearing face masks reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in community settings?		
This rapid review identified seven observational studies in community settings that compared wearing face masks with not wearing face masks on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, with six studies suggesting that wearing masks may reduce the risk of transmission.		

Can wearing face masks play a role in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 in households or schools?		
Studies of face masks to reduce transmission of influenza or ILI in households or schools have suggested that adherence with wearing face masks may play an important role in determining their effectiveness31,46, although further research is needed.		

Does consistent face mask use reduce the risk of contracting illnesses like COVID-19?		
The effectiveness of mask-wearing we observed is consistent with previous studies, including a randomized-controlled trial showing that consistent face mask use reduced risk for influenza-like illness (28), 2 case-control studies that found that mask-wearing was associated with lower risk for SARS infection (29,30), and a retrospective cohort study that found that mask-wearing by index patients or family members at home was associated with lower risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection (31).		

Can wearing face masks, combined with hand hygiene and good compliance, reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection?		
Previous studies on the use of face masks by healthy people in the community have considered other respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-1, influenza, or influenza-like illness (ILI), and have provided some weak evidence that face masks may reduce the risk of infection, particularly when implemented early, combined with hand hygiene and subject to good levels of compliance26–35.

Published research on the effectiveness of border barriers is limited and offers conflicting results in terms of how much of a role barriers play in deterring unauthorized entry in the U.S.		

Does the evidence support the claim that barriers are effective in reducing illegal drug, border crossings, and human smuggling activities in the United States?		
Border barriers can discourage unauthorized border crossings, but the research is mixed in terms of how much they deter migrants from entering the U.S. without permission.		

Does the deployment of barriers on the US-Mexico border lead to a shift in the location of illegal drug crossings from areas with barriers to areas without barriers?		
CBP figures for drugs - excluding marijuana - seized on the southern border also show most come through ports of entry, although a report by the Congressional Research Service does state that border barriers can serve to push people to cross in places where they are more likely to be ""detected, intercepted, and detained"".

Do the available data on apprehensions made by the US Border Patrol accurately reflect the actual number of unauthorized northbound border crossings in areas where barriers are deployed in the United States?		
Although data are available on the number of apprehensions made by the US Border Patrol, these figures are underestimates of the true numbers of unauthorized northbound border crossings and depend on factors such as trends in border patrolling efforts in given periods.

16,The plentiful evidence we have indicates that masks would not meaningfully help with aerosol transmission of COVID 19.,"Can a face mask mandate be effective in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 if it does not lead to increased compliance and does not reduce contact between people?		
Even though there is now significant agreement in the medical literature that respiratory transmission of COVID-19 is the dominant vector (Meyerowitz et al. 2020), and many clinical studies have shown that face masks reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and similar illnesses (Chu et al. 2020, Prather et al. 2020, Leung et al. 2020, Greenhalgh et al. 2020), a face mask mandate may not be effective in practice if it fails to increase the prevalence of mask wearing (compliance), or if it leads to increased contact due to a false sense of security.		

Does the evidence suggest that N95 masks are more effective than surgical masks in preventing the transmission of COVID-19?		
Although surgical masks have lower filtration efficiency than N95 respirators, observational studies have shown no significant benefit of N95 masks over surgical masks for prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (odds ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.22-3.33) or other respiratory viruses (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.85-1.08).3 For health care workers, routine care for a patient with COVID-19 if both are wearing surgical masks is not considered to be a high-risk occupational exposure.3 Yet, SARS-CoV-2 viral particles have been identified in the air for several hours after an aerosolizing event simulated in a laboratory and near air vents in a clinical setting.3 A group of 239 scientists recently signed an open letter urging the World Health Organization and other international public health bodies to recommend additional precautions (though not N95 masks specifically) to protect against potential airborne transmission, highlighting several recent superspreading events in which SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurred in poorly ventilated areas.5 These instances raise concern for the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission; however, the viability and infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in aerosol form remains unknown.		

Does the evidence suggest that masks are effective in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 through aerosols?		
However, a recent study in patients with seasonal coronaviruses has demonstrated that surgical face masks significantly reduced detection of viral RNA in aerosols and shows a trend in reducing viral RNA in droplets.4 A recent meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials also showed that surgical masks are as effective as N95 masks in reducing transmission of influenza‐like diseases.6 If the result from a case–control study during the SARS‐CoV‐1 outbreak in Hong Kong is any indication, frequent masks use (mainly surgical) in public places can be protective by 64%.7		

Do surgical face masks and masks made of dense cotton fabrics effectively prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 into the environment through coughing of patients with COVID-19?		
The answer is highly relevant to guide public behaviour (Leung et al., 2020). One study suggests that a surgical face mask and masks made of dense cotton fabrics apparently cannot effectively prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 into the environment through the coughing of patients with COVID-19 (Bae et al., 2020; Klompas, Morris, Sinclair, Pearson, & Shenoy, 2020).		

Does the evidence suggest that homemade fabric masks are effective in preventing the transmission of aerosols implicated in the spread of COVID-19?		
Limited, indirect evidence from lab studies suggests that homemade fabric masks may capture large respiratory droplets, but there is no evidence they impede the transmission of aerosols implicated in the spread of COVID-19, according to a paper published yesterday by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.		

Does the effectiveness of face masks in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 depend on the population's compliance with mask usage and the effectiveness of the masks themselves?		
The use of face masks can be effective at reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-21, 2. Theoretical studies show that the extent of disease outbreaks is dependent on population compliance with mask usage and effectiveness of the masks at reducing viral transmission3.		

Can surgical masks be effective in preventing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through airborne transmission?		
Importantly, no documented SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks have been linked to settings in which surgical masks were assiduously used in lieu of N95 masks, which suggests that even if airborne transmission is a considerable contributor to SARS-CoV-2 transmission, surgical masks are likely sufficient to prevent it.3 Because the infectious dose of virus required to cause clinical infection also remains unknown, it is possible that blocking most, even if not all, viral particles through masks with lower filtration efficiencies of submicron particles is sufficient to prevent disease in the vast majority of cases.		

Does the study mentioned in the evidence suggest that face masks can prevent the transmission of COVID-19 through aerosol transmission?		
Another study, “Respiratory virus shedding in exhaled breath and efficacy of face masks”, published in Nature Research on 3 April, found that face masks could prevent the transmission of human coronaviruses by filtering respiratory droplets.		

Do face masks help in blocking the transmission of airborne pathogens such as SARS and COVID-19?		
When it comes to controlling the spread of respiratory illnesses, face masks can help. A study from 2008 found that surgical masks were 68 percent effective in blocking the transmission of SARS, while N95 masks (a type of respirator mask that filters airborne particulate matter) were more than 90 percent effective.		

Does the evidence from laboratory filtration studies suggest that fabric masks can reduce the transmission of COVID-19?		
The CDC failed to reference the National Academies of Sciences Rapid Expert Consultation on the Effectiveness of Fabric Masks for the COVID-19 Pandemic (NAS 2020), which concludes, “The evidence from…laboratory filtration studies suggests that such fabric masks may reduce the transmission of larger respiratory droplets.

Biden disagreed that a higher minimum wage would lead to companies going out of business. Studies on the topic remain mixed; the Congressional Budget Office estimated in July 2019 that 1.3 million workers would be out of a job if the federal minimum wage was raised to $15 an hour, but other studies have disputed this outcome.		

Does the US administration support the Raise the Wage Act that would increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour?		
A $15 minimum wage would increase wages for over 33 million U.S. workers and lift 1.3 million people out of poverty—nearly half of them children.82 However, days before the passage of the Raise the Wage Act, the administration issued a Statement of Administration Policy recommending that President Trump veto the bill if it reaches his desk.83

44,Deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at “pox parties” could be a good way to help create herd immunity against COVID-19 without a vaccine.,"Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at “pox parties” a recommended method for achieving herd immunity against COVID-19?		
Herd immunity for COVID-19 through natural infection can pose many challenges. COVID-19 can cause serious complications and millions of deaths, therefore the experts recommend trying to achieve herd immunity through vaccination.		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a recommended method for achieving herd immunity against COVID-19?		
Herd immunity against COVID-19 should be achieved by protecting people through vaccination, not by exposing them to the pathogen that causes the disease.		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at “pox parties” a scientifically supported and morally justifiable method for creating herd immunity against COVID-19 without a vaccine?		
However, according to the World Health Organization, “Attempts to reach herd immunity through exposing people to a virus are scientifically problematic and morally unethical.”		

Is the claim that deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" is a good way to create herd immunity against COVID-19 supported by the evidence provided?		
Controversial 'pox parties' which see children intentionally infected with diseases to build immunity could become popular if Covid-19 vaccine does not come to the rescue, scientist says		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a recommended method by the WHO to achieve herd immunity?		
WHO supports achieving 'herd immunity' through vaccination, not by allowing a disease to spread through any segment of the population, as this would result in unnecessary cases and deaths.		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at “pox parties” supported by scientific evidence?		
Managing COVID-19 by allowing herd immunity to develop in low-risk populations while protecting the most vulnerable is ""a dangerous fallacy unsupported by the scientific evidence,"" warn an international group of 80 researchers in an open letter.		

Is deliberately infecting children with COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a safer alternative to vaccination for achieving herd immunity?		
A vaccine for the virus that causes COVID-19 would be an ideal approach to achieving herd immunity. Vaccines create immunity without causing illness or resulting complications.		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at “pox parties” still considered a viable method to create herd immunity against COVID-19 without a vaccine?		
Pursuing herd immunity deliberately now seems more ethically dubious than ever for elected officials, Bauer says, given that individual recovery from COVID-19 also appears to be a fraught process.		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at “pox parties” supported by scientific evidence?		
Herd immunity, which occurs when enough people become immune to a contagious disease to make further spread unlikely, is a ""dangerous fallacy unsupported by the scientific evidence,"" the scientists wrote.		

Is there sufficient evidence to support the claim that deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at “pox parties” could be a good way to help create herd immunity against COVID-19 without a vaccine?		
It is currently unclear how herd immunity could happen for COVID-19. For example, the data are insufficient to show how much immunity infection confers, or whether it’s enough to prevent re-infection.

45,Cutting the umbilical cord straight away deliberately denies the baby natural immunity so that medical professionals have a reason to vaccinate and medicate them.,"Is there evidence that delayed umbilical cord clamping is beneficial to infants, and if so, why is it not widely implemented in many countries?		
Despite the available evidence that delayed umbilical cord clamping is more beneficial to infants, as well as the existence of 2014 WHO recommendation that the umbilical cord should be clamped between 1 and 3 minutes, its implementation is still low in many countries including Tanzania.		

Does cutting the umbilical cord immediately after birth cause harm to the baby, and is this a reason for medical professionals to vaccinate and medicate them?		
It has now been shown to provide no benefit to the mother and to result in harm to the neonate. The clinical trial evidence relating to delayed cord clamping compared to immediate cord clamping is presented and the physiological rationale for delayed cord clamping is discussed in this paper.		

Does delayed umbilical cord clamping provide a benefit to the baby, despite the claim that it denies them natural immunity?		
However, the authors concluded that given the benefit of delayed umbilical cord clamping in term infants, delayed cord clamping is beneficial overall, provided that the obstetrician–gynecologist or other obstetric care provider has the ability to monitor and treat jaundice.		

Does delaying the clamping of the umbilical cord increase the baby's natural immunity?		
A more liberal approach to delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in healthy term infants appears to be warranted, particularly in light of growing evidence that delayed cord clamping increases early haemoglobin concentrations and iron stores in infants.		

What is the current recommended timing for umbilical cord clamping, and how has it changed over time?		
However, those protocols have since been revised to recommend delayed umbilical cord clamping (1). Thus, analysis of the timing of umbilical cord clamping in relation to postpartum haemorrhage is considered important.		

Does cutting the umbilical cord immediately after birth deny the baby natural immunity, which in turn leads to a need for medical professionals to vaccinate and medicate them?		
Term and preterm infants appear to derive benefit from delayed umbilical cord clamping; therefore, delayed umbilical cord clamping for at least 30–60 seconds is recommended in term and preterm infants except when immediate umbilical cord clamping is necessary because of neonatal or maternal indications.		

Is delayed cord clamping a standard practice in full-term births?		
Delayed cord clamping is not standard medical practice in full-term births. The standard of care in obstetrics right now only calls for delayed cord clamping with premature babies who are more in need of the increase in blood volume compared to full-term babies.		

Does the timing of umbilical cord clamping have any impact on a baby's natural immunity?		
Although many randomized controlled trials that involved term and preterm infants have compared the benefits of delayed umbilical clamping with those of immediate cord clamping, the ideal timing for umbilical cord clamping in specific circumstances warrants further investigation.		

Does cutting the umbilical cord immediately after birth prevent the baby from receiving a natural transfusion of blood from the placenta?		
Delayed cord clamping provides more placental transfusion between the placenta and the newborn, whereas immediate cord clamping allows for immediate resuscitation of the premature newborn by a neonatologist (193).		

Is the World Health Organization's recommendation for delayed cord clamping related to the claim that cutting the umbilical cord straight away deliberately denies the baby natural immunity so that medical professionals have a reason to vaccinate and medicate them?		
More mothers than ever before are inquiring about delayed cord clamping (DCC). This rise correlates with the World Health Organization’s recommendation that the umbilical cord should not be clamped earlier than necessary.

46,The umbilical cord should not be cut until 1 hour after birth or they baby will not have enough blood right after birth.,"What is the recommended waiting time for cutting the umbilical cord after birth, according to the evidence provided?		
Delayed cord clamping, defined as waiting to clamp the umbilical cord for one to three minutes after birth or until cord pulsation has ceased, is associated with benefits in term infants, including higher birth weight, higher hemoglobin concentration, improved iron stores at six months, and improved respiratory transition.35 Benefits are even greater with preterm infants.36 However, delayed cord clamping is associated with an increase in jaundice requiring phototherapy.35 Delayed cord clamping is indicated with all deliveries unless urgent resuscitation is needed.		

What is the recommended length of time to delay cutting the umbilical cord after birth?		
Delaying cord clamping for at least 30–60 seconds after delivery is recommended by national and international organizations.1–6 In term newborns, delayed cord clamping has been shown to increase blood volume,7		

What is the recommended waiting time for clamping and cutting the umbilical cord after birth, according to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)?		
Recommendations for when to clamp and cut the cord differ. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) advises waiting 30 to 60 seconds after the birth of a preterm infant, but acknowledges there is insufficient evidence to support delayed cord clamping in full-term infants born in areas that do not lack resources.		

What is the recommended length of time for delayed cord clamping according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)?		
Delayed cord clamping appears to be helpful for both full-term and preterm babies. For this reason, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends delayed cord clamping for at least 30 to 60 seconds after birth for most babies.		

Is there evidence that delayed umbilical cord clamping is beneficial to infants, and if so, why is it not widely implemented in countries like Tanzania?		
Despite the available evidence that delayed umbilical cord clamping is more beneficial to infants, as well as the existence of 2014 WHO recommendation that the umbilical cord should be clamped between 1 and 3 minutes, its implementation is still low in many countries including Tanzania.		

What is the recommended length of time to wait before cutting the umbilical cord in both term and preterm infants?		
Term and preterm infants appear to derive benefit from delayed umbilical cord clamping; therefore, delayed umbilical cord clamping for at least 30–60 seconds is recommended in term and preterm infants except when immediate umbilical cord clamping is necessary because of neonatal or maternal indications.		

What was the standard practice for umbilical cord clamping before 1960?		
Until 1960, delayed umbilical cord clamping (DCC) to promote placental transfusion was common; afterward, cord clamping immediately after birth became standard practice to reduce the risk of postpartum hemorrhage, although without evidence (1, 2).		

What is the World Health Organization's recommendation regarding the timing of clamping the umbilical cord?		
In 2007, the World Health Organization recommended that “the cord should not be clamped earlier than necessary.2 Also, in 2008, a Cochrane review showing the effect of the timing of clamping the umbilical cord on maternal and neonatal outcomes in term infants was published”.		

Does delaying the clamping of the umbilical cord result in an increase in the baby's blood volume?		
Traditionally, practitioners have clamped the umbilical cord immediately after birth. Previous studies have shown that delaying cord clamping results in a 20 to 30 percent increase in an infant’s blood volume.		

Is there any evidence to support delaying umbilical cord clamping for full-term infants?		
ACOG guidelines only recommend delaying umbilical cord clamping for preterm deliveries, citing a lack of evidence to support the benefits of DCC in full-term infants.

The growth rate of total COVID-19 cases in Italy has been slowing since March 8, according to the Italian Civil Protection Department, and, in the past few days, the total new daily cases have finally started to shrink, suggesting Italy is ‘flattening the curve,’ meaning that it is slowing the spread of the virus.		

What does ""flattening the curve"" mean in the context of containing the spread of the COVID-19 virus?		
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) broke out in early December 2019, in Wuhan, China. It was not until late January of 2020 that it became a global pandemic, spreading across neighboring countries and beyond.1 For all the infected countries, the goal of containing the virus was to be achieved by flattening the “curve”, which simply meant attaining fewer new cases than the previous day.2 Flattening the curve became imminent to curtail the spread of the virus so as to reduce the burden on the healthcare system, allowing for better treatment and performance of healthcare workers.3

82,In the US lockdowns are partly responsible for excess deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19 which were observed in 2020.,"What percentage of excess deaths in the US during March and April 2020 were attributed to causes other than COVID-19?		
The study, “Excess Deaths from COVID-19 and Other Causes, March-April 2020,” showed that only 65% of the excess deaths that occurred in March and April were attributed to COVID-19, meaning more than one-third were linked to other causes.		

Did the study find that non-COVID-19 deaths increased in states with the most COVID-19 deaths during the early weeks of the pandemic?		
Previous studies of excess deaths (the gap between observed and expected deaths) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic found that publicly reported COVID-19 deaths underestimated the full death toll, which includes documented and undocumented deaths from the virus and non–COVID-19 deaths caused by disruptions from the pandemic.1,2 A previous analysis found that COVID-19 was cited in only 65% of excess deaths in the first weeks of the pandemic (March-April 2020); deaths from non–COVID-19 causes (eg, Alzheimer disease, diabetes, heart disease) increased sharply in 5 states with the most COVID-19 deaths.1 This study updates through August 1, 2020, the estimate of excess deaths and explores temporal relationships with state reopenings (lifting of coronavirus restrictions).		

Do the excess deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19 observed in 2020 have a temporal relationship with the state lifting of coronavirus restrictions?		
This study updates a previous report of the estimated number of excess deaths in the US during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic through August 1, 2020, and describes causes of those deaths and temporal relationships with state lifting of coronavirus restrictions.		

What weeks in 2020 were analyzed in the study to examine excess deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19?		
This article presents provisional analysis of excess deaths in 2020 that did not involve the coronavirus (COVID-19), focussing on the weeks from which death registrations involving COVID-19 were first recorded.		

Of the excess deaths in the US in 2020, what percentage were not directly attributed to COVID-19?		
The number of excess all-cause deaths was 28% higher than those of COVID-19 deaths. They noted that,“the deaths officially attributed to COVID-19 accounted for 78% of the excess all-cause deaths, leaving 22% unattributed to COVID-19.		

Do the reported excess deaths in the US in 2020, which are not directly attributed to COVID-19, align with the estimated actual death toll from COVID-19, which is likely to be twice as high as reported?		
There are reports of excess mortality in some countries during the Covid-19 pandemic. Rivera et al. (2020) found that Covid-19 mortality figures in the US underestimate the actual death toll, and that Covid-19 mortality is likely to be twice as high as reported.		

Do the excess deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19 in 2020 in the US potentially represent misclassified COVID-19-related deaths or deaths indirectly caused by the pandemic?		
Finally, estimates of excess deaths attributed to COVID-19 might underestimate the actual number directly attributable to COVID-19, because deaths from other causes might represent misclassified COVID-19–related deaths or deaths indirectly caused by the pandemic.		

How do excess deaths, as measured by the evidence, relate to the claim that lockdowns are partly responsible for excess deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19 in the US in 2020?		
- Measuring excess deaths allows us to understand the full impact of COVID-19 on mortality, including deaths indirectly related to COVID-19.		

Are lockdowns partly responsible for excess deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19 which were observed in 2020 due to underreporting in the early phases of the pandemic?		
additional excess deaths, not directly attributed to COVID-19, may be due to underreporting in the early phases of the		

How do estimates of excess deaths provide information about the burden of mortality potentially related to COVID-19, beyond the number of deaths that are directly attributed to COVID-19?		
Estimates of excess deaths can provide information about the burden of mortality potentially related to COVID-19, beyond the number of deaths that are directly attributed to COVID-19.

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci claim that face masks caused bacterial pneumonia in the 1918 influenza pandemic?		
In the most recent influenza pandemic that did not involve the use of antibiotics to suppress bacteria (the 1918–1919 pandemic), histological and bacteriologic evidence suggests that the vast majority of influenza deaths resulted from secondary bacterial pneumonia.

124,PTFE Sprayed On Blue Masks Causes Symptoms Similar To COVID-19,"What are the potential health effects of inhaling PTFE particles, particularly in relation to respiratory symptoms?		
The respiratory effects of PTFE are usually focused on acute toxicity. Heated PTFE particles may cause symptoms that range from mild flu-like symptoms to severe symptoms, such as pulmonary edema [11, 12].		

Can inhaling PTFE fumes cause symptoms similar to COVID-19?		
Numerous case studies in the 1900s have documented flu-like symptoms after inhalation of PTFE fumes by workers in PTFE-using factories and by people overheating non-stick pans in the kitchen.		

Does PTFE sprayed on blue masks pose a risk to human health?		
Risk of “Teflon flu” due to inhalation of fumes during typical kitchen use is minimal. Ingestion of PTFE is not reported to be toxic and residual PFOA in PTFE-coated pans is minimally transferred to food.		

Can exposure to PTFE particles cause lung disease symptoms similar to those of COVID-19?		
Chronic lung disease found in PTFE-spraying workers has been reported [8]. However, the pathophysiology of PTFE particle-induced chronic lung disease has not been reported.		

What are the long-term health effects of repeated exposure to PTFE fumes?		
These cases of Teflon flu are due to acute (short-term) exposures to PTFE fumes; no studies have been done looking at the long-term effects of brief, repeated PTFE-fume exposure, as would be the case in cooking using non-stick pans for a lifetime.		

Are the blue masks being referred to in the claim actually contaminated with PTFE compounds?		
Review of the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) showed that the lubricant contained polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) compounds, and warned smokers about the health hazards associated with the contamination of cigarettes with PTFE.		

Do employees exposed to PTFE fumes experience symptoms similar to those associated with COVID-19?		
Clinical phenomena in employees exposed to fumes from the processing of PTFE have been reported.53  After		

Can exposure to PTFE particles cause lung lesions similar to those found in COVID-19?		
This case demonstrates that long-term exposure to PTFE spraying can cause granulomatous lung lesions such as pneumoconiosis; such lesions appear to be caused not by the degradation products of PTFE from high temperatures but by spraying the particles of PTFE.		

Does inhaling PTFE particles, which are released when PTFE is heated, cause symptoms similar to COVID-19?		
In summary, inhalation toxicity becomes a concern when PTFE is heated to high temperatures which releases toxic particles and gases that could result in polymer fume fever.		

Is PTFE, a chemical used in some blue masks, linked to serious health effects such as cancer and thyroid disease?		
Teflon is a brand name for PTFE, one of thousands of fluorinated chemicals known as PFASs or PFCs [1] – some of which have been linked to serious health effects including cancer, thyroid disease and reduced effectiveness of childhood vaccines.

Was Ulysses S. Grant a slave owner at the time of his presidency?

135,No one lost their health care because of the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill.,"What type of health insurance policies were allowed to be sold in Iowa under the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill?		
The Iowa situation became even more complicated this spring, when Iowa legislators approved a controversial plan to let Wellmark partner with the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation to sell 2019 policies that don’t comply with Affordable Care Act regulations or state rules.		

What is the result of the merger of the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill?		
The bill was merged last week with another proposal that would allow the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation to work with Wellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield to sell health insurance plans that don't comply with the federal Affordable Care Act to its own members.		

What type of health plan did the Iowa Farm Bureau partner with Wellmark to offer, and how does it differ from traditional insurance?		
The Iowa Farm Bureau partnered with Wellmark (Blue Cross) on a new self-funded benefit plan. The state’s legislation requires that the health plan be sponsored by a local nonprofit agriculture organization and explicitly defines the plan as “not insurance,” exempting the plan from most state insurance regulation as well as regulation required under the ACA.		

What was the nature of the partnership between Iowa's Farm Bureau and Wellmark before the Affordable Care Act was passed under President Barack Obama?		
Iowa's Farm Bureau for years partnered with Wellmark to market health-insurance plans before the Affordable Care Act was passed under President Barack Obama.		

Did the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill lead to an increase in health care costs for individuals in Iowa?		
Iowa’s Farm Bureau statute is making a bad situation worse for the state’s individual market. Thanks to a number of decisions by state policymakers and the dominant insurance company – Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield – premiums in the state’s individual market are already among the highest in the country, with an average annual marketplace plan premium in excess of $10,000 in 2018.		

What was the purpose of the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation's Farm Bureau Health Plan?		
- The Iowa Farm Bureau Federation’s Farm Bureau Health Plan was designed to help unsubsidized Iowans afford a health plan and represents the controversy surrounding association health plans.

With SF 2329, lawmakers have turned to a partnership that before ACA provided the majority of individual health insurance policies to rural Iowans for decades: Iowa Farm Bureau and Wellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield.		

What is the purpose of the new health plans released by the Iowa Farm Bureau?		
The Iowa Farm Bureau released some information Wednesday about new health plans that are meant to be a cheaper alternative to health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA).		

What types of health care coverage could be deleted from the new coverage under the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill?		
Such denials have generally been banned since 2014 by Obamacare. The bill also would let Wellmark and the Farm Bureau delete some types of coverage, such as for maternity or mental health care, from the new coverage.		

What was the expansion of the eligibility criteria for the Farm Bureau Health Plan?		
The Iowa Farm Bureau, which launched a new health benefit plan for Iowans in November, recently expanded the eligibility of the Farm Bureau Health Plan to include those who are eligible for their employer’s health care plans but are looking for more affordable options.

137,it is unknown whether a person under 20 can pass the disease to an older adult.,"Can a person under 20 years old pass COVID-19 to an older adult?		
There is new evidence, including from a recent comprehensive study from South Korea, suggesting there is an age gradient in terms of transmission risk from children, meaning younger children (<10 years old) are less likely to transmit compared to adults, while older children (10 and older) may transmit at levels similar to adults.		

Can a child under 20 be a source of infection for an older adult?		
Without a doubt transmission from child-to-child and child-to-adult can occur, but a number of studies find children, particularly young children, are less likely to be source of infection in households and other settings, compared to adults.		

Can a person under 20 years old pass the disease to an older adult?		
Although children and young adults are reportedly at lower risk for severe disease and death from infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), than are persons in other age groups (1), younger persons can experience infection and subsequently transmit infection to those at higher risk for severe illness (2–4).		

Can a person under 20 years old transmit COVID-19 to an older adult?		
There is some evidence for an age gradient in infectiousness, with younger children less likely and older children more likely to transmit at levels similar to adults.		

Can a person under 20 pass the disease to an older adult?		
Evidence so far indicates that children are at a lower risk of infection, present with milder symptoms, and are much less likely to die from the infection compared to older adults, but they still could present a risk to others in their household, especially in households with people at higher risk, such as older adults and others with pre-existing conditions.		

Can children under 20 years old transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus to older adults?		
Preliminary evidence suggests that children have a lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with adults, but the role that children and adolescents play in transmission of this virus remains unclear.		

Does the evidence suggest that people under 20 are less likely to be infected with the disease compared to adults?		
One prominent study estimated susceptibility to infection for those under 20 years of age to be about half that of those over 20 years, and several large-scale seroprevalence studies have found lower prevalence of infection in children, especially younger children, compared to adults.		

Does the age group under 20 have a higher or lower likelihood of transmitting the disease to an older adult compared to older children?		
disease and transmission is likely to be higher in older than younger children [21,22].   		

Do children under 20 develop symptoms less frequently because their body reacts better to the virus once they get infected, or do they get infected less frequently?		
According to a study recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, for instance, less than 1 percent of recorded COVID-19 cases in China were in children younger than 10.11 However, one credible hypothesis is simply that children develop symptoms less frequently because their body reacts better to the virus once they get infected, rather than because they get infected less frequently.12,13 More research needs to be done on this, but if that were the case, it would mean that children are very subtle vectors of the disease.		

What biological or other factors could be contributing to the lower transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from children to older adults?		
Therefore, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from children is plausible. Considering the relatively low frequency of infected children, even in severely affected areas, biological or other unknown factors could lead to the lower transmission in this population.

139,A campaign ad video for John Cornyn says that his plan would guarantee insurers must sell plans to any patient with preexisting conditions and will be covered in his plan.,"Does John Cornyn's plan guarantee that insurers must sell plans to any patient with preexisting conditions without any exclusions for treatment?		
- Issue: A current Republican legislative proposal would permit insurers to offer plans that exclude coverage of treatment for preexisting health conditions, even while the bill would maintain the Affordable Care Act’s rule prohibiting denial of coverage to people with a preexisting condition.		

Does John Cornyn's plan guarantee the same protections for people with pre-existing conditions as the Affordable Care Act?		
A majority of Americans favor retaining the provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that prohibit insurers from denying coverage or charging more to people with preexisting health conditions.1 In fact, a proposed Senate bill, the Republican-backed Ensuring Coverage for Patients with Pre-Existing Conditions Act, would maintain certain provisions under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that prevent insurers from refusing coverage to people or varying premiums based on whether they have a preexisting condition.2		

What does John Cornyn's proposed bill, the Ensuring Coverage for Patients with Pre-Existing Conditions Act, require insurers to cover in terms of pre-existing conditions?		
While the Ensuring Coverage for Patients with Pre-Existing Conditions Act maintains the ACA’s provisions that require insurers to enroll individuals with preexisting conditions, the proposed bill would not require that the conditions themselves be covered.		

Does John Cornyn's plan guarantee that insurers must sell plans to patients with pre-existing conditions?		
However, in contrast with the ACA, the proposed legislation would permit insurers to sell plans that entirely exclude coverage for treatment of an enrolled individual’s preexisting condition (Exhibit 1).3 Prior to the ACA’s implementation in 2014, plans sold in the individual market often incorporated such coverage exclusions.4		

What is the stance of public officials, including those from John Cornyn's party, on protecting Americans with pre-existing conditions from being denied coverage?		
The ACA's provision on preexisting conditions has survived many challenges. Public officials of both major political parties have expressed commitment to the issue and have offered various plans to protect Americans with preexisting conditions from being denied coverage.		

Does John Cornyn's plan guarantee full coverage for pre-existing conditions?		
This bill would prevent insurers from refusing or varying premiums based on preexisting conditions. But, unlike the ACA, this bill would allow insurers to sell plans that entirely exclude coverage for care pertaining to the preexisting conditions themselves.		

Does John Cornyn's plan guarantee that insurers must sell plans to any patient with preexisting conditions?		
Cornyn said it is a lie to say he is “opposed to covering preexisting conditions” and that he has “co-sponsored legislation to do that” independent of Obamacare.		

Does the campaign ad video for John Cornyn accurately describe the impact of his plan on insurers' requirements to sell plans to patients with pre-existing conditions?		
Senator Cassidy promised earlier than any final health bill would provide protection for individuals with pre-existing conditions, but Senator Collins has said that her reading of this bill is that it would allow for higher, possibly unaffordable rate increases for persons with pre-existing conditions.		

How does John Cornyn's plan compare to President Trump's previous stance on pre-existing condition protections?		
President Trump’s record includes support for legislation to repeal and replace the ACA that would have weakened pre-existing condition protections, and expansion of short-term insurance plans that are not required to cover pre-existing conditions.		

Does John Cornyn's plan guarantee that insurers must sell plans to any patient with preexisting conditions?

Though Trump says he would do this, his administration has consistently taken steps to undermine the Affordable Care Act – including joining a lawsuit aimed at striking down the law – without presenting alternative plans that would offer similar benefits.

FACT CHECK: While President Trump and Republicans have repeatedly insisted on protecting preexisting conditions, the Trump administration is currently in court seeking to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, which guarantees coverage for Americans with preexisting medical conditions.

What is the Trump administration's stance on protecting pre-existing conditions and the Affordable Care Act?		
Protecting coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. The Trump administration has abandoned its duty to defend current laws in court, cheering on efforts to destroy protections for pre-existing conditions, insurance coverage for dependents until they’re 26, and the other critical Affordable Care Act benefits.		

Does the plan proposed by President Trump and you involve changing the current protections for people with pre-existing conditions under the Affordable Care Act?

What does President Trump's past support for congressional proposals to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act suggest about his plan to improve healthcare and protect pre-existing conditions for every American?

The notion that sexual activity might affect prostate cancer risk has been controversial. A meta-analysis published in 2002 reported that increased ejaculation frequency and having more sexual partners were associated with prostate cancer risk, but age at first intercourse was not.		

Is there an inverse relationship between ejaculation frequency and the risk of prostate cancer?		
Background: Evidence suggests that ejaculation frequency may be inversely related to the risk of prostate cancer (PCa), a disease for which few modifiable risk factors have been identified.

Having a greater frequency of ejaculations did not increase prostate cancer risk. On the contrary, very frequent ejaculations might decrease total prostate cancer and organ-confined cancer risk.		

Is there an association between frequent ejaculation and the risk of developing prostate cancer in men of different age groups?		
Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in men. In January 2009, a study reported that frequent masturbation by men in their 20s was associated with an increased risk of developing prostate cancer, but that it lowered the risk for men in their 50s.

Either way, you'll have to do it a lot. Men who ejaculated 21 times per month had a 20% lower risk of developing prostate cancer than those who orgasmed ""only"" 4-7 times per month, according to the study's lead author, Harvard epidemiologist, Jennifer Rider.

192,It makes no sense for oil to be cheaper in Nigeria than in Saudi Arabia.,"How do the production costs of oil in Saudi Arabia compare to other countries?		
Meanwhile, the location and size of Saudi's oil fields also help keep its production costs down. While it's not the cheapest in the world, as several nations have production costs around $2 per barrel, it's still a fraction of the production costs of a country like Canada, which pays $11.56 to produce a barrel of oil.

Canada's oil sands represent the third largest reserves in the world after Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, but its crude trades at a substantial discount to other North American grades due to its low quality and limited pipeline access to market.		

How do global market prices for crude oil affect the reported ""proven reserves"" of oil in countries like Venezuela?		
While Venezuela has reported ""proven reserves"" topping those reported by Saudi Arabia, industry analyst Robert Rapier has suggested that these numbers reflect variables driven by changes in crude oil market prices—indicating that the percentage of Venezuela's oil that qualifies as Venezuela's ""proven"" reserves may be driven up or down by the global market price for crude oil.[17]		

Why is Nigeria's oil production lower than its estimated capacity?

The E-6B Mercury that executes the ""Take Charge And Move Out"" (TACAMO) mission for America's sprawling nuclear apparatus, basically delivering commands from the National Command Authority that can send nuclear-armed ballistic missiles flying during a nuclear apocalypse, is an incredible aircraft.		

Are the E-6B Mercury planes deployed because of US President Trump's positive COVID-19 test?

Similarly, despite public health officials unanimously endorsing the need for widespread COVID-19 testing to contain the spread of the virus, Trump blamed testing itself for the rapidly rising number of COVID-19 cases and stated at a campaign rally that he told officials to “slow the testing down, please.”		

Is the claim that COVID-19 will go away if people stop getting tested supported by the evidence that testing, particularly of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals, is key to interrupting the spread of the virus?		
Therefore, COVID-19 can spread quickly in these communities, and the impact of that spread is great. Testing, particularly of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals, is key to interrupting this spread.		

Does the number of reported COVID-19 cases accurately reflect the actual number of people infected with the virus?		
Considering that a large number of cases are asymptomatic (or present with very mild symptoms) and that testing has not been performed on the entire population, only a fraction of the SARS-CoV-2 infected population is detected, confirmed through a laboratory test, and officially reported as a COVID-19 case.

COVID-19 reported among children. The virus can be fatal in cases, so far mainly among older people

Is the increase in reported Covid-19 cases due to increased testing?		
Myth 7: Spikes in cases are because of increased testing. As coronavirus cases began surging in many parts of the U.S. in recent months, Trump has frequently claimed that these spikes are merely to the result of more people being tested.		

Does the claim that COVID-19 will go away if you stop getting tested, it's just the elderly dying and people are being intentionally infected, align with the evidence that comorbidities increase the chances of infection?		
Due to COVID-19 being a relatively new and understudied disease, the data available is limited. However, from the cases that emerged, it was observed that comorbidities increase the chances of infection [7].		

Will stopping COVID-19 testing lead to a decrease in the spread of the virus?		
Testing of all people for SARS-CoV-2, including those who have no symptoms, who show symptoms of infection such as trouble breathing, fever, sore throat or loss of the sense of smell and taste, and who may have been exposed to the virus will help prevent the spread of COVID-19 by identifying people who are in need of care in a timely fashion.		

According to the CDC, can people who have COVID-19 and are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic still transmit the virus to others?		
Although scientists and health care professionals continue to study the spread of COVID-19 to learn more about its presentation, transmission and immunity, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that “a significant portion of individuals with [COVID-19] lack symptoms (“asymptomatic”) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (“pre-symptomatic”) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms.”

Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality will take some time to fully understand, existing data suggest that the mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of reported cases) is between 3-4%.		

Does the CDC estimate the death rate of COVID-19 as being less than the seasonal flu?		
It is true that the CDC has reported the possibility of a 0.2% death rate for the coronavirus.

The ad’s numbers are correct on who is protected under the ACA: The Center for American Progress, a Democratic-leaning public policy think tank, estimated in 2019 that 4.1 million Michiganders with pre-existing conditions would stand to lose coverage through ACA if the law was struck down in the pending Supreme Court case Texas v. United States.

What is the potential impact of Trump's efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act on individuals with pre-existing conditions?		
He supports a lawsuit currently before the Supreme Court to overturn the ACA in its entirety, and expanded the availability of short-term insurance plans that have lower premiums but can exclude coverage of preexisting conditions and ACA-required benefits.

Besides being slow to respond to the crisis, the US administration also sought to undermine the scientific consensus on the origins of SARS-CoV-2, putting pressure on US intelligence to support unproven theories of the virus's origins in a Wuhan laboratory.37 The Wuhan lab theory conflicts with the scientific consensus, which suggests COVID-19 originated in bats.38 Scientists have debated three transmission mechanisms—zoonotic transfer following natural selection in an animal host; natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer; and selection during laboratory escape.39

Going forward, Congress could move to repeal Section 230 entirely, says Jeff Kosseff, the author of The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet.

Section 230 was virtually unnoticed at the time of passage, as the focus was largely on the Senate’s indecency language, which would soon be struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.		

When was Section 230, the legislation which shields online platforms from liability for user-generated content, passed?		
Section 230, the 26 words at the heart of Mr. Kosseff’s book, was little noticed when the CDA was passed in 1996.		

What does the term ""Section 230"" refer to in the context of US legislation?		
“Section 230” refers to a portion of the Communications Decency Act that was added to the Communications Act by the 1996 Telecommunications Act, codified at 47 U.S.C. 230.		

What was the primary purpose of the Communications Decency Act, which includes Section 230?		
Section 230 was only a small portion of that broader legislation. The Communications Decency Act’s broader purpose was to slow the spread of child pornography on the web.

What type of organization is the NFL registered as, which allows it to be exempt from paying taxes?		
The reason the NFL doesn’t pay taxes is beyond outdated at this point. The league is a registered 501(c)(6), which “provides for exemption of business leagues, chambers of commerce, real estate boards, boards of trade, and professional football leagues.”

The politically charged nature of the Black Lives Matter debate was evident in a recent sermon at an Oklahoma church, as a white minister named Mike Mazzalango questioned the organization’s agenda and blamed Black Americans for the nation’s abortion problem.		

What is Bubba Watson questioning about the phrase ""Black Lives Matter""?		
But as some advocates of saying “Black Lives Matter” see it, the organization’s agenda is not the main reason many Christians oppose the expression.		

What is one common misconception about the Black Lives Matter movement that has been circulating on social media?

Does wearing a face mask help prevent the spread of coronavirus by blocking larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles?		
This is false; experts agree that while the virus itself is small enough to fit through mask fibers -- as is vape smoke -- masks do help stop the much-larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles, and multiple studies have indicated that masks reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.		

Does the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of coronavirus depend on the type of substance being inhaled through the mask?		
With a surgical mask, coronavirus was not detected in either respiratory droplets or aerosols, suggesting that surgical masks may be effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19.		

Does the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of the coronavirus have any basis in scientific studies, or is it based on research from other viruses like the flu?		
Research on masks' effectiveness against the coronavirus is, at best, inconclusive. Most of what we currently know about masks, from N95s to simple cloth barriers, is based on studies of the flu and other respiratory viruses.		

Does the viral video accurately represent the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of coronavirus?		
A viral video misrepresents scientific papers and the reasons for wearing face masks to claim that they are ineffective in mitigating transmission of COVID-19.		

Do the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend wearing a cloth face covering despite the claim that face masks are ineffective in preventing the spread of COVID-19?		
Currently, the scientific consensus is that face masks are at least somewhat effective at preventing the spread of COVID-19, and both the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend wearing a cloth face covering.		

Do face masks made of surgical material or dense cotton fabrics effectively prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 into the environment through coughing?		
The answer is highly relevant to guide public behaviour (Leung et al., 2020). One study suggests that a surgical face mask and masks made of dense cotton fabrics apparently cannot effectively prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 into the environment through the coughing of patients with COVID-19 (Bae et al., 2020; Klompas, Morris, Sinclair, Pearson, & Shenoy, 2020).		

Does the available evidence support the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of coronavirus?		
First, the evidence for the effectiveness of face masks in reducing viral transmission is very weak. Few studies examine the use of face masks in community settings; those that do find no evidence of reduced transmission compared with no face masks.(2,3) Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence: both recent systematic reviews cautiously suggest that in some circumstances, wearing of face masks may be warranted.(2,3)		

Do face masks help prevent the spread of the coronavirus?		
Face masks are a simple way to help decrease coronavirus transmission and save lives. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wearing a face mask in public places has been shown to reduce the spread of COVID-19, because those who are pre-symptomatic can spread the virus before showing symptoms.		

Can face masks prevent the spread of coronavirus through respiratory droplets or aerosols?		
Surgical face masks may therefore be effective against COVID-19 transmission [17-19]. Thus, face masks can probably protect against virus infection by reducing the risk that virus enters the mouth or nose via respiratory droplets or aerosols.

The Social Security trust fund could be depleted by 2023 if President Trump were to permanently eliminate the payroll tax and not offer a replacement revenue source, the chief actuary of the Social Security Administration said Monday.		

Would cutting payroll taxes result in Social Security payments ending by the middle of 2023 if no alternative funding source is provided?		
Payments for Social Security benefits will end by the middle of 2023 if President Donald Trump were able to deliver on his promise of permanently cutting payroll taxes, and if another funding source was not provided to replace it, according to an estimate from the chief actuary of the Social Security Administration.		

How would President Trump's proposal to eliminate payroll taxes affect the Social Security trust funds?		
President Trump’s proposal to eliminate payroll taxes would deplete the Social Security retirement trust fund by 2023, and its disability insurance fund by the middle of next year, according to the Social Security Administration.		

Does US President Donald Trump's proposal to cut social security result in the permanent depletion of the Social Security Trust Funds?		
This is something President Trump has proposed twice. The analysis found that the Social Security Disability Insurance Trust Fund would be permanently depleted by mid-2021 and the Social Security Old Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund would be permanently depleted by mid-2023.		

Would the elimination of the payroll tax lead to the depletion of the Social Security trust fund by 2023?		
The Social Security trust fund would be exhausted by 2023 if the payroll tax was eliminated without an alternative source of revenue to replace it, according to the Social Security Administration's chief actuary in a letter released yesterday.

Does the Social Security Administration's chief actuary agree with President Trump's plan to cut social security?		
The Social Security Administration’s chief actuary estimated late Monday that eliminating the payroll tax would fully deplete Social Security’s disability and old-age trust funds by 2023, confirming the disastrous consequences progressive advocacy groups and lawmakers have been warning of since President Donald Trump threatened earlier this month to “terminate” the levy if reelected in November.		

Would eliminating employee payroll taxes as proposed by President Trump result in the depletion of the Social Security trust fund?		
As our analysis based on the Social Security trustees’ projections shows, eliminating employee payroll taxes along the lines that the president has proposed would, absent additional action, completely exhaust the Social Security trust fund by 2026 or earlier and result in steep benefit cuts.		

What would be the outcome of a hypothetical cut to Social Security, according to the Social Security Administration's chief actuary?		
Stephen Goss, the chief actuary at the Social Security Administration, told the senators in his response that the hypothetical cut would cause the Social Security Disability Insurance Trust Fund to be depleted by mid-2021 and the Social Security Trust Fund reserves ""would become permanently depleted by the middle of calendar year 2023, with no ability to pay… benefits thereafter.""		

Does the US President's claim that Social Security will be permanently depleted by the middle of calendar year 2023 align with the Social Security Administration's projections?

443,It's NOT a SECOND WAVE of COVID-19 coming soon. It's the NORMAL COLD / FLU SEASON,"Does the World Health Organization believe that COVID-19 follows seasonal variations common to influenza and other coronaviruses, such as the common cold?		
The Covid-19 pandemic is currently unfolding in “one big wave” with no evidence that it follows seasonal variations common to influenza and other coronaviruses, such as the common cold, the World Health Organization has warned.		

Is COVID-19 expected to be seasonal like the flu?		
It is possible that COVID-19 could turn out to be a seasonal illness, similar to influenza. However, experts warn that, at least for now, amid the ongoing pandemic, warmer weather is unlikely to drive the disease away.		

Is the increase in COVID-19 cases in the US related to the end of the flu season?		
In the US, the flu season is coming to an end, whereas COVID-19 numbers continue to rise. So, flulike symptoms should prompt concern for COVID-19.		

What is the basis for the comparison between COVID-19 and SARS?		
Some experts believe a second wave is inevitable, based on the history of infectious diseases such as SARS, a respiratory illness caused by a virus that is genetically related to the coronavirus, which causes COVID-19.		

What are some seasonal illnesses that have similar presentations to COVID-19?		
COVID-19 syndromic surveillance is severely complicated by its similar presentation and overlapping timeframe with a variety of seasonal illnesses, such as the common cold, allergies, and influenza.		

What does the World Health Organisation spokesperson suggest is a more accurate way to understand the spread of COVID-19?		
Amid continued debates over what constitutes a second wave, a resurgence or seasonal return of the disease, Margaret Harris, a WHO spokesperson, insisted that these discussions are not a helpful way to understand the spread of the disease.		

Is the second wave of COVID-19 mentioned in the claim the same as the second wave of flu infections that sometimes occur during flu season?		
Flu seasons sometimes feature a second wave of infections. But in those cases, the second wave is a distinct new surge in cases from a strain of flu that is different than the strain that caused earlier illnesses.		

Is the upcoming increase in COVID-19 cases expected to be a major resurgence of cases that strikes all parts of the country simultaneously?		
A second wave, he said, ""usually refers to a major resurgence of cases in the autumn that could strike all parts of the country more or less simultaneously, since viral respiratory pathogens are generally more transmissible in the autumn and winter.""		

Why is the current increase in COVID-19 cases being attributed to the normal cold/flu season rather than a second wave of the virus?		
Experts determined COVID-19 to be more deadly than the seasonal flu. There is a vaccine for the seasonal flu, keeping cases down; there is not a vaccine for COVID-19.		

Why might people mistakenly attribute their COVID-19 symptoms to the flu during flu season?		
Without quickly learning which virus they have, some people with COVID-19 during flu season might mistakenly attribute their symptoms to influenza and not take the necessary precautions to prevent spreading severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is more easily transmitted, he said.

444,The World Health Organization (WHO) says there is no proof that face masks protect against Covid-19.,"Did the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend mass use of masks for healthy individuals in the community in January 2020?		
We previously highlighted some inconsistency in WHO's initial January, 2020, guidance on this issue.1, 2 WHO had not yet recommended mass use of masks for healthy individuals in the community (mass masking) as a way to prevent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in its interim guidance of April 6, 2020.3 Public Health England (PHE) has made a similar recommendation.4 By contrast, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now advises the wearing of cloth masks in public5 and many countries, such as Canada, South Korea, and the Czech Republic, require or advise their citizens to wear masks in public places.6, 7, 8 An evidence review9 and analysis10 have supported mass masking in this pandemic.		

Does the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend wearing face masks in the community setting to prevent the acquisition of COVID-19?		
However, the use of face mask in the community remains controversial.21 , 22 WHO issued an interim guideline regarding the use of masks in the context of COVID-19 on 6 April 2020, stating no evidence that wearing a mask by healthy persons in the wider community setting can prevent acquisition of COVID-19.23 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control issued a technical report on 8 April 2020 that the use of face masks in the community could be considered, especially when visiting busy, closed spaces, despite not knowing how much the use of masks in the community can contribute to a decrease in transmission in addition to the other counter measures.24 On 3 April 2020, CDC recommended the use of cloth face coverings, especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.25		

Did the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend the routine wearing of face masks by the general public as a means of preventing the spread of COVID-19 at the time of the claim?		
The issue of mask wearing has been widely debated in the press and the World Health Organization (WHO) have recently changed their advice, to now recommend the routine wearing of face masks by the general public as a means of preventing the spread of COVID‐19 (WHO, 2020a).		

Does the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend wearing face masks for protection against COVID-19 as of May 2020?		
Despite growing evidence on the value of masking and calls for public use of masks as part of a broader strategy that also includes social distancing and hand washing [, ], recent commentary suggests that public guidance on masks may be inconsistent across nations [ ], and the World Health Organization (WHO) maintains, as of May 2020, that masks are only needed for healthy individuals when they are taking care of someone with suspected COVID-19 [ ].		

Did the World Health Organization initially recommend against wearing face masks in areas of widespread COVID-19 transmission?		
Even the cautious and consensus-driven World Health Organization, which initially recommended against masks, now encourages their use in areas of widespread COVID-19 transmission137, in light of new information on the disease and the results of large-scale comparative studies135.		

Does the World Health Organization (WHO) agree that wearing masks can help prevent the wearer from infecting others with Covid-19?		
Wearing masks against COVID-19 is beneficial in suppressing pandemic spread, not through preventing the wearer from being infected but by preventing the wearer from infecting others, according to suggestions from the World Health Organization (WHO, 2020a,b,c) and lessons from previous pandemics, such as the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic and the 2009 influenza A virus subtype H1N1 pandemic (Mniszewski et al., 2014; Leung et al., 2020).		

What does the World Health Organization (WHO) say about the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of Covid-19?		
WHO published updated guidance on the use of masks for the control of COVID-19, which provided updated advice on who should wear a mask, when it should be worn and what it should be made of.		

Has the World Health Organization (WHO) changed its stance on the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19?		
The World Health Organization (WHO) has changed its advice on face masks, saying they should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible to help stop the spread of coronavirus.		

Has the World Health Organization (WHO) updated its stance on the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19?		
The WHO has updated its interim guidance on the use of masks in the context of COVID-19 on 5 June 2020		

Does the World Health Organization's statement that there is no proof that face masks protect against Covid-19 accurately reflect the current state of evidence on the effectiveness of face masks in reducing viral transmission?		
First, the evidence for the effectiveness of face masks in reducing viral transmission is very weak. Few studies examine the use of face masks in community settings; those that do find no evidence of reduced transmission compared with no face masks.(2,3) Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence: both recent systematic reviews cautiously suggest that in some circumstances, wearing of face masks may be warranted.(2,3)

The claim is misleading; wearing a face mask does not negatively impact the immune system, according to health experts; as of July 2020, international health authorities and governments around the world recommended wearing face masks as part of efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19.		

Does wearing a face mask weaken the immune system?		
The idea that wearing face masks weakens the immune system is not supported by scientific evidence. This article published on The Conversation illustrates how wearing even a cloth face covering can help to limit the spread of COVID-19 by blocking infectious droplets, which is the main mode of disease transmission.		

Does wearing a face mask weaken the immune system?		
There is no evidence that face masks weaken the immune system. Risks associated with wearing face masks only apply to a select few in the general population.		

Does stress, rather than masks, lower the immune system?		
Finally, while masks do not weaken the immune system, stress might. Now is a stressful time, and unfortunately, stress has been linked with changes in immune system function and increased risk of infections.		

Can wearing a mask weaken the immune system?		
Experts say there is no evidence that masks harm the body by increasing carbon dioxide inhalation, decreasing oxygen intake or weakening the immune system.		

Does wearing a mask weaken the immune system?		
There is no evidence that mask use weakens the immune system. We all have harmless types of bacteria living on the surface of our bodies, and evidence suggests that they might affect the way our immune systems behave, but wearing a mask does not make these bacteria go away.		

Does wearing a face mask protect the immune system from COVID-19?

446,"US President Trump made vaccines voluntary, not mandatory, in the US.","Does the president have the authority to make vaccines mandatory in the US?		
Mandating vaccination is a state power, not within the president’s jurisdiction. Trump will also lack the power to directly change the CDC’s recommended vaccination schedule, but he can appoint a new director to the CDC or the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.		

Did the Trump administration have control over vaccine guidance in the US?		
The Trump administration has sought to control vaccine guidance issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) — a customarily apolitical scientific regulator tasked with certifying the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, medications, and other medical treatments and technologies.		

Did the Trump administration block the vaccine guidelines initially?		
The Trump administration later attempted to block the vaccine guidelines but ultimately allowed their implementation after protests from experts and the biotech industry concerned about undermining public trust in the FDA.		

Did the Trump administration make vaccines mandatory in the US?		
The Trump administration’s efforts to politicize and undermine vaccine safety measures are especially damaging given the administration’s 2019 decision to close down the National Vaccine Program Office — a government body tasked with monitoring the safety of vaccines.		

How did the approach to HPV vaccination mandates in the US relate to the policy of making vaccines voluntary under President Trump?		
Mandates for HPV vaccination in the US, where there was a high degree of population hesitancy and politicization around the vaccine, were notably ineffective.		

Was there a COVID-19 vaccine available for distribution in the US in March 2020?		
The claim is false; neither Trump nor the pharmaceutical executive make any reference to a vaccine being ""ready"" for distribution; as of March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) states there is not yet a vaccine for COVID-19.		

Are vaccines mandatory in the US?

447,A virus can easily pass through a mask.,"Can a virus be transmitted through the air as an aerosol, and if so, do N95 respirators provide better protection than medical masks against viral respiratory infections?		
Respiratory viruses are primarily transmitted by large droplets. Because a fraction of respiratory viruses may be transmitted by aerosol, N95 respirators have been presumed to provide better protection than medical masks against viral respiratory infections in health care settings.2 However, definitive evidence of greater clinical effectiveness of N95 respirators is lacking.		

Can surgical masks effectively filter out airborne viruses of various sizes?		
Some surgical masks may let a significant fraction of airborne viruses penetrate through their filters, providing very low protection against aerosolized infectious agents in the size range of 10 to 80 nm.		

Do surgical masks prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2?		
A previous study reported that surgical masks and N95 masks were equally effective in preventing the dissemination of influenza virus (4), so surgical masks might help prevent transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS–CoV-2).		

Do face masks provide substantial protection against viral respiratory infections?		
Yes. Face masks reduce the spread of viral respiratory infection. N95 respirators and surgical masks both provide substantial protection (compared with no mask), and surgical masks provide greater protection than cloth masks.		

Can a surgical mask prevent the transmission of a virus through respiratory droplets and aerosols?		
An April study found that surgical masks reduced the transmission of multiple human coronaviruses (though the research did not include this new one, SARS-CoV-2) through both respiratory droplets and smaller aerosols.		

Can a virus pass through a surgical mask and cause infection?		
Importantly, no documented SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks have been linked to settings in which surgical masks were assiduously used in lieu of N95 masks, which suggests that even if airborne transmission is a considerable contributor to SARS-CoV-2 transmission, surgical masks are likely sufficient to prevent it.3 Because the infectious dose of virus required to cause clinical infection also remains unknown, it is possible that blocking most, even if not all, viral particles through masks with lower filtration efficiencies of submicron particles is sufficient to prevent disease in the vast majority of cases.		

Does the evidence suggest that a virus can easily pass through a mask?		
Although surgical masks have lower filtration efficiency than N95 respirators, observational studies have shown no significant benefit of N95 masks over surgical masks for prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (odds ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.22-3.33) or other respiratory viruses (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.85-1.08).3 For health care workers, routine care for a patient with COVID-19 if both are wearing surgical masks is not considered to be a high-risk occupational exposure.3 Yet, SARS-CoV-2 viral particles have been identified in the air for several hours after an aerosolizing event simulated in a laboratory and near air vents in a clinical setting.3 A group of 239 scientists recently signed an open letter urging the World Health Organization and other international public health bodies to recommend additional precautions (though not N95 masks specifically) to protect against potential airborne transmission, highlighting several recent superspreading events in which SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurred in poorly ventilated areas.5 These instances raise concern for the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission; however, the viability and infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in aerosol form remains unknown.		

Do medical masks provide any protection against respiratory viral infections?		
A previous study showed that 2-ply cotton masks are ineffective in preventing respiratory viral infections (RVI) (2), while other studies have demonstrated efficacy of the medical masks in decreasing RVI (3, 4).		

Do face masks with less than 95% filtration efficiency provide protection against the acquisition of SARS-CoV-2?		
Evidence from previous studies suggests that even face masks with less than 95% FFE (eg, surgical masks) are effective in preventing acquisition of epidemic coronaviruses (ie, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1, SARS-CoV-2) by clinicians and other health care workers except possibly during aerosol-generating procedures.9-11 For prevention of a related coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1, N95 respirators had no increased prevention benefit over surgical masks.10		

What percentage of respiratory droplets that can spread SARS-CoV-2 are blocked by surgical masks?		
In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 is primarily spread by large (>5-10 μm) respiratory droplets that can be expelled up to 6 feet horizontally and drop to the ground within seconds, against which surgical masks generally offer adequate protection.2,3 Nonetheless, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that health care workers use N95 masks when caring for patients with confirmed or suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) out of concern for airborne transmission, particularly during exposure to procedures that produce high concentrations of aerosols (eg, intubation, extubation, noninvasive ventilation).2 To mitigate the shortage of N95 respirators, many health care facilities are pursuing nonstandard approaches to maintaining an adequate supply, including mask decontamination and reprocessing for reuse, which extend the wearable life of the mask beyond the expiration date, and procuring KN95 masks (N95 masks that are regulated in China).

Does wearing a face mask cause a significant decrease in oxygen levels (hypoxia) in healthy individuals during physical activity?		
Although the body of literature directly evaluating this issue is evolving, for healthy individuals, the available data suggest that face masks, including N95 respirators, surgical masks, and cloth face masks, may increase dyspnea but have small and often difficult-to-detect effects on Wb, blood gases, and other physiological parameters during physical activity, even with heavy/maximal exercise.

456,idol of goddess Kali was burnt in West bengals Murshidabad by the muslim community.,"What was the relationship between the Muslim community in Murshidabad and the local ruler during the early modern period in Bengal?		
The representation of the goddess electing to bless the Muslim nawab is extremely significant. It underlines the strong possibility, borne out by other aspects of Bengals’ social and cultural history during the early modern period, that to a segment of Bengal's population, the nawabs of Murshidabad were not alien oppressors, but rather, their immediate ruler and someone who was doing his best to expel the external invaders.		

What is the historical context of the region of Murshidabad in West Bengal?		
A lore ascribes the significance of the development of the kumbhar community in the present region. According to the lore, the first kumbhar was brought over to the region from Krisnanagar (Nadia district in Bengal) by Raja Nabakrisna Deb to build a Durga idol to commemorate the worship of the deity in honour of the victory of the British at the Battle of Plassey against the Muslim power of Siraj-ud-Daullah in 1757.		

What is the historical context of the worship of the goddess Kali in West Bengal's Murshidabad district?

What is the significance of the discovery of the temple and the idol of goddess Kali in West Bengal's Murshidabad district, as reported by the Dhaka Tribune?		
According to the Dhaka Tribune, the find of the temple and the idol may change predominant ideas about the region’s history and traditions.		

Did the evidence suggest that the idol of goddess Kali was burnt in West Bengal's Murshidabad by the Muslim community?

In light of the protections afforded by section 2(b) of the Charter and the objectives set out in the Act, the Commission reminds the public that for the Commission to take action on a complaint relating to the broadcast of false or misleading news, the breach of the false or misleading news provisions must be flagrant.

462,US cable news channel Fox News is not available in Canada due to media legislation in the country.,"Did the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approve Fox News for broadcast in Canada in 2004?		
Fox Chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch was rebuffed in his efforts to establish Fox News Canada in 2003 due to Canadian laws regarding foreign ownership of print and broadcast media, but the CRTC approved an application to bring the Fox News Channel to Canadian digital television line-ups back in November 2004, and that channel is now carried by dozens of different digital providers throughout Canada.		

Does the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) regulations apply to non-Canadian entities transmitted via satellite and cable?

Was Fox News approved for transmission in Canada by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission?		
The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved an application Thursday to bring the Fox News Channel, one of the highest-rated news channels in the United States, onto Canadian digital airwaves.		

Is there a law in Canada that prohibits the broadcasting of false information as news?		
Since at least 2011, rumors have circulated claiming the Fox News television channel has been banned in Canada due to their running afoul of Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) prohibitions that make it ""illegal to broadcast lies and label it news"":

Is Fox News classified as an ""entertainment"" channel in Canada?		
(The claimed distinction that Fox News Channel is only allowed in Canada due to its being classified as an ""entertainment"" channel rather than as a ""news"" channel is a meaningless one, as those classifications only apply to Canadian media outlets, and Fox is an American company.)		

In what year did the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission reject Fox News' bid for broadcast in Canada?

Bison numbered in the tens of millions across North America before the West was settled. By the 1880s, unchecked commercial hunting to feed the bison hide market reduced the population to about 325 animals in the U.S. and fewer than 1,000 in Canada, according to wildlife officials and bison trade groups in Canada.		

Did the colonizers' actions lead to a significant decline in the North American bison population?		
In the early 1800s, an estimated 65 million bison roamed throughout the continent of North America. However, hunting and poaching had a devastating effect on the bison population; and by 1890, fewer than 1,000 remained.
