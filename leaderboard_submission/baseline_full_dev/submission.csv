5,The United States of America and its Western allies have been using their media outlets to publish articles based on fabricated information under allegations of non-compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention.,"What allegations have been made by the United States of America and its Western allies against Russia regarding the Chemical Weapons Convention in Syria?		
The war in Syria has put the issue of attribution in the spotlight, particularly in instances where CWC member-state Russia, which is Syria’s ally, has used its UN Security Council veto to thwart investigations.		

Have the United States of America and its Western allies been publishing articles based on fabricated information about Syria's compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention?		
But despite confirmed use of sarin by the Syrian government by both the Joint Investigative Mechanism and the OPCW’s own fact-finding mission, the OPCW has not taken any collective measures.		

Are the United States of America and its Western allies the only countries that have been accused of publishing fabricated information under allegations of non-compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention?		
The data also show that the Syrian government has been largely undeterred by the efforts of the United Nations Security Council, the international Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), and unilateral action by individual countries to enforce the prohibition on Syria’s use of chemical weapons.		

Have the United States of America and its Western allies accused the Syrian government of non-compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention?		
The United Nations (UN), on numerous occasions, has confirmed the use of chemical weapons in Syria.

The number of confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. is estimated to be 377,883 in 2020. This total far exceeds 173,040, the total number of preventable injury death in 2019 (latest official count available).		

If the US had acted more responsibly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, how many fewer deaths are estimated to have occurred?		
The sheer magnitude of the COVID-19 crisis is hard to fathom. As of the published date of this report, the death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic has topped 215,000 in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University.		

Would a more effective US response to COVID-19 have resulted in fewer deaths?		
Had we handled the coronavirus as effectively as any of these three countries, roughly 99% of the 117,858 U.S. Covid-19 deaths might have been averted.		

If lockdowns and social distancing had started two weeks earlier, how many deaths from COVID-19 could have been prevented?		
Our conclusions are strengthened by their consistency with the results from different methodologies. Two notable epidemiological projections, based on theoretical models of transmission and “idealized hypothetical assumptions,” have estimated that between 80% and 90% of American deaths could have been averted had lockdowns and social distancing begun two weeks earlier.		

Would a faster COVID response in the US have reduced the number of deaths from COVID-19?		
More than 120,000 Americans have now perished from Covid-19, surpassing the total number of U.S. dead during World War I. Had American leaders taken the decisive, early measures that several other nations took when they had exactly the same information the U.S. did, at exactly the same time in their experience of the novel coronavirus, how many of these Covid-19 deaths could have been prevented?		

What was the average daily number of COVID-19 deaths in 2020?		
During much of 2020 COVID deaths averaged more than 1,200 a day. Earlier in 2021, increasing vaccination rates helped to decrease the average number of deaths below 500 per day.		

How do the similarities in population density, urbanization, and the timing of the pandemic in other countries compared to the US affect the estimated number of COVID-19 deaths?		
At least three factors enable meaningful comparisons of these nations with the United States. First, we scaled up their population sizes and Covid-19 deaths to match those of the U.S. Second, in each of these countries, roughly 80% or more of the population lives in urbanized, transmission-prone areas, similar to the U.S. Third, the pandemic took root earlier in these other countries than here, as measured by the date of the 15th confirmed case in each, meaning that foreign leaders had to act with less information to guide their decisions than did U.S. leaders.		

How long did it take for the US to reach the first 500,000 COVID-19 deaths compared to the time it took to reach the most recent 500,000 deaths?		
- Data from John Hopkins University shows the most recent 500,000 Coronavirus deaths occurred in the space of six weeks, at the start of the pandemic it took six months to reach the first 500,000 deaths.		

Did countries that took earlier and more decisive steps to combat COVID-19 experience lower death tolls compared to the US?		
Yet other countries with the same information — or alleged misinformation — as the U.S. had at the time took earlier, decisive steps to quell the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.		

What percentage of COVID-19 deaths in the US could have been prevented if the country had implemented policies similar to those of other countries?		
That isn’t a hypothetical question. And the answer that emerges from a direct comparison of the fatalities in and policies of the U.S. and other countries — South Korea, Australia, Germany, and Singapore — indicates that between 70% and 99% of the Americans who died from this pandemic might have been saved by measures demonstrated by others to have been feasible.

The big picture: Trump didn't invent this idea. The notion that detonating a nuclear bomb over the eye of a hurricane could be used to counteract convection currents dates to the Eisenhower era, when it was floated by a government scientist.		

Did Trump's idea of detonating a nuclear bomb over the Atlantic to stop hurricanes ever become a formal policy proposal?		
- The sources said that Trump's ""bomb the hurricanes"" idea — which he floated early in the first year and a bit of his presidency before John Bolton took over as national security adviser — went nowhere and never entered a formal policy process.		

Did Donald Trump suggest detonating a nuclear bomb over the Atlantic to stop hurricanes?		
Reacting to the report, Trump declared it to be “fake news,” suggesting the claim that he “wanted to blow up large hurricanes with nuclear weapons prior to reaching shore” was “ridiculous.”		

Did Donald Trump suggest using nuclear bombs to disrupt hurricanes?

Shortly after Trump came to power National Geographic published an article pointing out how frequently the idea of nuking hurricanes has been raised over the last few decades.		

Did Donald Trump suggest detonating a nuclear bomb over the Atlantic to address climate change or hurricane frequency?		
To be clear, Trump would be far from the only person to ever suggest it. Dennis Feltgen, public affairs officer for the National Hurricane Center, says he gets between three and four dozen emails every hurricane season from concerned citizens suggesting climatological nuclear warfare.		

Has Donald Trump suggested that the US military should take action to disrupt hurricanes before they make landfall?		
Donald Trump has reportedly suggested on more than one occasion that the US military should bomb hurricanes in order to disrupt them before they make landfall.

11,The U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control both previously said that ‘masks are not effective in preventing [the] general public from catching coronavirus.’,"Did the initial guidance from the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control on the effectiveness of masks in preventing the spread of coronavirus change over time?		
Early messaging from health experts likely contributed to this misconception as health officials, including the U.S. Surgeon General, communicated that masks were not necessary for the general public’s protection.2 Guidance has since changed, as it is estimated that over 40% of people who have the virus are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic spreaders and are likely unaware of their infectious potential.3, 4		

Were face masks effective in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus according to the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control?		
U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams had initially advised against the general public wearing face masks, saying they were ""not effective"" in preventing people from contracting COVID-19 and amplified the risk of health-care providers being unable to get them.		

Did the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control change their views on the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus?		
Editor's note: Health officials' views on wearing face masks have shifted as the outbreak spreads. On Friday, April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC now recommends Americans wear a ""basic cloth or fabric mask,"" not a medical-grade mask, in public.		

What do the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control say about the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus?		
COVID-19 guidelines issued by WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other agencies have been consistent about the need for physical distancing of 1–2 m but conflicting on the issue of respiratory protection with a face mask or a respirator.2 This discrepancy reflects uncertain evidence and no consensus about the transmission mode of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).		

Did the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control previously recommend that the general public wear masks to prevent catching the coronavirus?		
Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization now recommend cloth masks for the general public, but earlier in the pandemic, both organizations recommended just the opposite.		

Do the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control recommend wearing face masks to prevent the general public from catching coronavirus?		
SARS-CoV-2 spreads person-to-person through close contact and despite current guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control recommending face masks, only a third of Americans wear a mask outside.1 With concerningly low rates of the public embracing the recommendation to wear a face mask, patients around the country are showing up at healthcare facilities without masks and some are refusing to wear one.		

Did the U.S. Surgeon General advise against buying masks in February 2020?		
But the U.S. government’s initial anti-mask messaging was so strong that the U.S. Surgeon General, Dr. Jerome Adams, tweeted on Feb. 29, “Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS!		

Do the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control agree that cloth masks are effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission?		
Our review of relevant studies indicates that cloth masks will be ineffective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, whether worn as source control or as PPE.		

Did the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control previously state that masks are not effective in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus?		
""Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others,"" the CDC's website says.		

Does wearing masks by the general public prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?		
Sweeping mask recommendations—as many have proposed—will not reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, as evidenced by the widespread practice of wearing such masks in Hubei province, China, before and during its mass COVID-19 transmission experience earlier this year.

12,New Zealand’s new Food Bill bans gardening,"What is the Food Safety Minister's concern regarding the new Food Bill?		
Food Safety Minister Kate Wilkinson says she is concerned that the Green Party is endorsing misinformation about the impacts of a new Food Bill.		

What is the main purpose of the new Food Bill in New Zealand, according to the given information?		
“The new Food Bill is about modernising legislation that is now 30 years old. It is about ensuring that people who sell and prepare food do so safely.		

Does the Food Bill in New Zealand have any relation to food labeling claims?		
Nevertheless, in light of the comprehensive regulatory scheme established for food labeling claims by the NLEA, the Commission is issuing this statement to clarify how its own authority relates to issues raised by FDA's food labeling regulations.		

What is the purpose of the FDA's regulations regarding food labels, as stated in the evidence?		
In addition to requiring nutrition information on virtually all food products, the NLEA directed FDA to standardize and limit the terms permitted on labels, and allows only FDA-approved nutrient content claims and health claims to appear on food labels.7 While the NLEA is designed in part to prevent deceptive and misleading claims on labels, Congress also intended that nutrient content and health claims educate consumers in order to assist them in maintaining healthy dietary practices.8 The NLEA also mandated that FDA undertake a consumer education effort to educate consumers about the new food label and the importance of diet to health.9 Therefore, in keeping with its recently expanded and unique jurisdictional mandate, the requirements set forth in FDA's regulations have a broader purpose than preventing false and misleading claims in food labeling.		

Does New Zealand's new Food Bill restrict the making of health claims about food products?		
The Commission shares the concerns underlying the NLEA, and embodied in FDA's regulations, that health claims be adequately substantiated and presented in a manner that is truthful and not misleading.		

Does the new Food Bill in New Zealand require advertisers to prove scientific consensus for their food claims?		
However, the Commission does not require food advertisers to establish that there is scientific consensus in support of their claims.		

Does the New Zealand Food Bill ban gardening?		
Therefore, while the Commission's purpose in issuing this statement is to provide guidance on how it will enforce Sections 5 and 12 in the food advertising area, the statement is not intended to provide a comprehensive analysis of how each of FDA's regulations relates to the Commission's enforcement policy.		

Does New Zealand's new Food Bill ban gardening?		
Instead, this statement focuses on the general issues that are likely to remain relevant to the Commission's regulation of food advertising over time, as specific provisions in the FDA regulations are amended.		

What does the New Zealand Food Bill regulate regarding food claims?		
4.2 In accordance with the Codex General Guidelines on Claims, claims on halal should not be used in ways which could give rise to doubt about the safety of similar food or claims that halal foods are nutritionally superior to, or healthier than, other foods.		

Is the Food Bill in New Zealand being misrepresented or distorted by some individuals for political gain?		
“For some time anonymous agitators have been spreading false information on the internet regarding the Food Bill and despite initially countering their views, Sue Kedgley has now buckled in order to chase their votes because it is an election year.

13,Wearing face masks will stop the spread of covid 19,"Does the use of face masks appear to be protective against the spread of COVID-19 in both healthcare and community settings?		
A systematic review on the efficacy of face coverings against respiratory viruses analyzed 19 randomized trials and concluded that use of face masks and respirators appeared to be protective in both health care and community settings (8).		

Is there evidence that wearing face masks can reduce the spread of COVID-19 based on data from previous epidemics and observational studies?		
Although no studies have examined SARS-CoV-2 transmission directly, data from previous epidemics (6,7) support the use of universal face coverings as a policy to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as does observational data for COVID-19 in an analysis of 194 countries that found a negative association between duration of a face mask or respirator policy and per-capita coronavirus-related mortality; in countries that did not recommend face masks and respirators, the per-capita coronavirus-related mortality increased each week by 54.3% after the index case, compared with 8.0% in those countries with masking policies (CT Leffler, Virginia Commonwealth University, unpublished data, 2020).§ Similar outcomes have been observed for other respiratory virus outbreaks, including the 2002–04 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (6) and the 2007–08 influenza season (7).		

Does the evidence from a systematic review and meta-analysis support the claim that wearing face masks will stop the spread of COVID-19?		
Face masks to prevent transmission of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis		

Is there an association between wearing face masks and a lower risk of contracting viral respiratory infections, including COVID-19?		
In observational studies, wearing masks is associated with a lower risk of contracting viral respiratory infections.3,4 For example, in a 2011 Cochrane systematic review published by Jefferson et al, the use of masks in case-control studies was associated with an important risk reduction (odds ratio = 0.32; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.39).3 However, the observational design is at high risk of confounding and mask use might simply be a surrogate measure for comparing more careful versus less careful people.		

Do face masks reduce the risk of infection from COVID-19?		
Face masks (surgical type) reduced infection risk by 85%. Since face masks are comparatively cheap and easy to use, they are among the most simple and straight forward means to curb SARS-Cov-2 and Covid-19 transmission (see also [53]).		

Does the available evidence support the claim that wearing face masks can stop the spread of COVID-19?

Does the available evidence support the claim that wearing face masks can effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19?		
Efficacy of face mask in preventing respiratory virus transmission: A systematic review and meta-analysis		

Are there any published studies that show wearing face masks can reduce the spread of COVID-19?		
Trials are under way to determine if masks can reduce the spread of COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov: and NCT04296643); however, none were published at the time of writing.		

Does wearing a face mask reduce the spread of COVID-19?

- El Paso Sector has experienced a significant reduction in drug and smuggling activities in areas where the new border wall system was built.		

What is the primary source of illegal drugs entering the United States?		
However strengthening and extending the border barrier is unlikely to do much to reduce illegal drugs - such as heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine - because most come through established border checkpoints, known as ports of entry.		

How do border barriers affect the location of narcotics seizures in the United States?		
- CBP’s San Diego Field Office continues to be a significant source of narcotics seizures. From FY 19 to FY 20, seizures of fentanyl, marijuana, and methamphetamine all increased, with meth seizures jumping at alarming rates in the past several years – demonstrating that the border wall is forcing drug smugglers to where we are best prepared to catch them – our ports of entry.

Do cloth masks and face coverings have a meaningful impact on reducing the transmission of COVID-19?		
In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19 transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with many potentially infectious people.		

Do FFP2 masks offer better protection against COVID-19 compared to surgical masks?

The aim of this article is to review the epidemiology of COVID-19 in HCWs, to interpret the scientific data on aerosol versus droplet transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of COVID-19), to compare basic characteristics between surgical masks and respirators, and to evaluate the evidence of protection between these two mask types.		

Is there any evidence that aerosol transmission of COVID-19 has been detected in settings where procedures that generate aerosols are performed?		
(38, 39) These observations suggest that aerosol transmission did not occur in this context. Further studies are needed to determine whether it is possible to detect viable SARS-CoV-2 in air samples from settings where no procedures that generate aerosols are performed and what role aerosols might play in transmission.

33,"America went from 75,000 flu deaths last year in 2019 to almost 0 in 2020","What were the estimated yearly flu deaths in the US between 2013-2014 and 2018-2019, according to the CDC?		
The CDC, like many similar disease control agencies around the world, presents seasonal influenza morbidity and mortality not as raw counts but as calculated estimates based on submitted International Classification of Diseases codes.2 Between 2013-2014 and 2018-2019, the reported yearly estimated influenza deaths ranged from 23 000 to 61 000.3		

Did the number of flu deaths in the US in 2020 decrease compared to the previous year?		
Based on the figure of approximately 60 000 COVID-19 deaths in the US as of the end of April 2020, this ratio suggests only a 1.0-fold to 2.6-fold change from the CDC-estimated seasonal influenza deaths calculated during the previous 7 full seasons.3 From our analysis, we infer that either the CDC’s annual estimates substantially overstate the actual number of deaths caused by influenza or that the current number of COVID-19 counted deaths substantially understates the actual number of deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2, or both.		

What was the highest number of flu deaths recorded during the peak week of the influenza season in the years leading up to 2020?		
By contrast, according to the CDC, counted deaths during the peak week of the influenza seasons from 2013-2014 to 2019-2020 ranged from 351 (2015-2016, week 11 of 2016) to 1626 (2017-2018, week 3 of 2018).6		

How did the number of flu deaths in 2020 compare to the number of flu deaths in 2019?		
The CDC also publishes provisional counts of COVID-19 deaths but acknowledges that its reporting lags behind other public data sources.7 For the week ending April 11, 2020, data indicate that the number of provisionally reported COVID-19 deaths was 14.4-fold greater than influenza deaths during the apparent peak week of the current season (week ending February 29, 2020), consistent with the ranges based on CDC statistics.6 As the CDC continues to revise its COVID-19 counts to account for delays in reporting, the ratio of counted COVID-19 deaths to influenza deaths is likely to increase.		

What is the estimated range of flu-related deaths in the United States during the 2018-2019 flu season?		
Since the 2010–11 season, CDC estimates that during each influenza season, influenza virus infection has caused 9.3 million–49 million symptomatic illnesses, 4.3 million–23 million medical visits, 140,000–960,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000–79,000 deaths.†††† Preliminary estimates for the 2018–19 season fall within these ranges.		

How many flu deaths were recorded during the peak week of the 2019-2020 influenza season compared to previous years?		
The mean number of counted deaths during the peak week of influenza seasons from 2013-2020 was 752.4 (95% CI, 558.8-946.1).7 These statistics on counted deaths suggest that the number of COVID-19 deaths for the week ending April 21 was 9.5-fold to 44.1-fold greater than the peak week of counted influenza deaths during the past 7 influenza seasons in the US, with a 20.5-fold mean increase (95% CI, 16.3-27.7).5,6		

What was the estimated number of flu deaths in the United States in 2019?		
Using data available from October 1, 2018, to May 4, 2019, CDC estimates that influenza virus infection has caused 37.4 million–42.9 million symptomatic illnesses; 17.3 million–20.1 million medical visits; 531,000–647,000 hospitalizations; and 36,400–61,200 deaths in the United States.		

What is the estimated number of flu deaths in 2020 according to the CDC?		
On average, the CDC estimates of deaths attributed to influenza were nearly 6 times greater than its reported counted numbers.		

Did the number of counted influenza deaths in 2020 decrease compared to the previous year?		
Over that same time period, however, the number of counted influenza deaths was between 3448 and 15 620 yearly.4		

How did the number of flu hospitalizations compare between adults and children in the 2019-2020 flu season compared to the 2017-2018 flu season?		
Compared with the 2017–18 influenza season, rates of hospitalization this season were lower for adults, but were similar for children.

Is there a link between 5G technology and the COVID-19 pandemic?		
More research and experiments are needed. In any event, any health effects from 5G are NOT COVID-19. The key takeaway is that the new wireless technology is not connected to COVID-19.		

Is there a link between the presence of 5G technology and the spread of COVID-19?		
The theory attempting to link the pandemic to 5G is senseless. The coronavirus is caused by a contagious virus, and it’s spreading in areas of the world that don’t yet have 5G technology!”

What is the basis for the claim that 5G is harmful to life?

FICTION: 5G networks cause the spread of COVID-19, or symptoms of the infection.

WHO will review scientific evidence related to potential health risks from 5G exposure as the new technology is deployed, and as more public health-related data become available.		

Are there any correlations between areas with 5G coverage and COVID-19 hotspots?		
One of the first 5G and coronavirus claims we checked, that the disease had broken out in Wuhan because of 5G there, re-emerged with claims that Covid-19 hotspots were also covered by 5G, and that cases on cruise ships could be explained by the radiation emitting technology used on them.		

Is there any scientific evidence to support the claim that 5G causes COVID-19?		
While there are a number of different variations to this theory, most share a belief that, even if the coronavirus is real, it is largely harmless, and the illness and death which is occurring is in fact caused by 5G. Proponents of the theory argue that the radiation from electromagnetic frequencies (EMF) generated by 5G towers, which are more powerful than those used by 4G and Wi-Fi networks, absorb oxygen in the air and from living organisms.

44,Deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at “pox parties” could be a good way to help create herd immunity against COVID-19 without a vaccine.,"Do proponents of ""pox parties"" believe that the immunity gained from catching chickenpox naturally is superior to the immunity gained from receiving the vaccine?		
Proponents of the Pox Parties believe that chickenpox is a harmless childhood disease and that catching chickenpox as a wild virus will provide better immunity later in life than the immunity achieved by receiving the vaccine.		

Is deliberately infecting children with COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a method that has been used in the past to create herd immunity against a viral disease?		
“Chickenpox parties” became popular in the 1970’s and 80’s as a way for parents to expose children to the virus at a young age, thereby avoiding any complications associated with contracting the disease later in life.		

Are ""pox parties"" for COVID-19 similar to the ""chickenpox parties"" that some parents participated in the past?		
In the past, some parents participated in “chickenpox parties” to intentionally expose their unvaccinated children to a child with chickenpox in hopes that they would get the disease.		

Are some parents choosing to expose their children to COVID-19 instead of getting vaccinated?		
Despite health experts saying the vaccine is highly effective and safe, some parents are still choosing to forgo this method and instead expose children to the chickenpox the old fashioned way — with an infection party.		

Are ""pox parties"" being promoted as a method to create herd immunity against COVID-19 without a vaccine?		
“Chickenpox parties”, which were prevalent in the 1970’s and 80’s, have re-emerged among social groups who identify as anti-vaccination.		

What is the belief of some parents regarding the effectiveness of natural immunity compared to vaccination?		
And although the vaccine exists, some parents believe the natural immunity children gain from getting the chickenpox is better than the shot.		

Are individuals with contraindications to vaccination, such as immunocompromised persons or pregnant women, at risk of severe disease if they are exposed to COVID-19 in an outbreak setting?		
Persons without evidence of immunity who have contraindications to vaccination (e.g., immunocompromised persons, pregnant women) should be excluded from an outbreak setting through 21 days after rash onset of the last identified case-patient because of the risk of severe disease in these groups.		

Does the long-term efficacy of COVID-19 immunity last at least 20 years?		
Although studies have shown that immunity through vaccination lasts at least 20 years, the long-term efficacy is still being monitored and assessed.		

What are the potential risks of deliberately infecting children with COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" according to the CDC?		
CDC strongly recommends against hosting or participating in these events. Chickenpox can be serious and can lead to severe complications and death, even in healthy children.		

What does the evidence suggest about the approach to creating herd immunity against COVID-19?		
[25]. Thus, to limit disease transmission during an outbreak and to provide protection against subsequent exposures, ACIP recommends that all persons without evidence of immunity to varicella be offered vaccine even if more than 5 days have passed since first exposure to the disease [9].

A more liberal approach to delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in healthy term infants appears to be warranted, particularly in light of growing evidence that delayed cord clamping increases early haemoglobin concentrations and iron stores in infants.		

What is the current recommended timing for umbilical cord clamping, and how has it changed over time?		
However, those protocols have since been revised to recommend delayed umbilical cord clamping (1). Thus, analysis of the timing of umbilical cord clamping in relation to postpartum haemorrhage is considered important.

These findings also suggest that immediate cord clamping (ICC) isn’t recommended unless the newborn is asphyxiated and needs immediate resuscitation.		

What is the primary reason for medical professionals to prefer immediate cord clamping over delayed cord clamping?		
Immediate cord clamping is considered less risky than DCC because it allows for immediate neonatal care or intervention and reduces the risk of certain neonatal complications.		

Is delayed cord clamping a standard practice in full-term births?		
Delayed cord clamping is not standard medical practice in full-term births. The standard of care in obstetrics right now only calls for delayed cord clamping with premature babies who are more in need of the increase in blood volume compared to full-term babies.		

Does cutting the umbilical cord immediately after birth have any relation to the need for vaccinations and medication in newborns?		
Although there is much debate surrounding the optimal time to clamp the umbilical cord, WHO’s findings suggest that late cord clamping (one to three minutes after delivery or longer) is recommended for all births.		

Does the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend waiting before cutting the umbilical cord?		
Recommendations for when to clamp and cut the cord differ. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) advises waiting 30 to 60 seconds after the birth of a preterm infant, but acknowledges there is insufficient evidence to support delayed cord clamping in full-term infants born in areas that do not lack resources.		

Is the World Health Organization's recommendation for delayed cord clamping related to the claim that cutting the umbilical cord straight away deliberately denies the baby natural immunity?		
More mothers than ever before are inquiring about delayed cord clamping (DCC). This rise correlates with the World Health Organization’s recommendation that the umbilical cord should not be clamped earlier than necessary.		

Does waiting to cut the umbilical cord pose any risks to the baby?

What is the recommended time frame for clamping the umbilical cord according to the World Health Organization?		
Although there is much debate surrounding the optimal time to clamp the umbilical cord, WHO’s findings suggest that late cord clamping (one to three minutes after delivery or longer) is recommended for all births.		

Is there evidence to support delaying umbilical cord clamping for full-term infants?		
ACOG guidelines only recommend delaying umbilical cord clamping for preterm deliveries, citing a lack of evidence to support the benefits of DCC in full-term infants.		

What time frame does the ACOG recommend for cord clamping after birth?		
The ACOG does not endorse the practice of delayed cord clamping but rather suggests cord clamping should take place between 30 to 60 seconds after birth, since the ideal timing for cord clamping has yet to be established.		

Do the World Health Organization and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend waiting before cutting the umbilical cord after birth?		
Research suggests delayed cord clamping is safe and beneficial for you and your baby. Both the WHO and ACOG recommend delayed clamping.		

Is delayed cord clamping a standard practice in full-term births?		
Delayed cord clamping is not standard medical practice in full-term births. The standard of care in obstetrics right now only calls for delayed cord clamping with premature babies who are more in need of the increase in blood volume compared to full-term babies.		

What is the recommended time frame for delayed umbilical cord clamping after birth?		
Delayed umbilical cord clamping is usually performed 25 seconds to 5 minutes after giving birth. DCC allows more blood to transfer from the placenta to the baby, sometimes increasing the child’s blood volume by up to a third.		

Does delaying the clamping of the umbilical cord increase the amount of blood and iron in a newborn baby?		
A more liberal approach to delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in healthy term infants appears to be warranted, particularly in light of growing evidence that delayed cord clamping increases early haemoglobin concentrations and iron stores in infants.		

What are the potential risks associated with waiting to cut the umbilical cord?		
However, delayed cord clamping does come with some risks and there continues to be significant debate about the risks and benefits of waiting to clamp the umbilical cord.

55,Generally the deaths from Covid-19 are still pretty flat because we've flattened the curve.,"Does the reported death rate from COVID-19 accurately reflect the actual death rate from the disease?		
However, it doesn't account for unconfirmed COVID-19 cases or unattributed excess deaths, and therefore carries uncertainties that may not reflect the disease's actual death rate.		

Are the daily numbers of Covid-19 cases and deaths increasing or decreasing?		
If cases and deaths are growing rapidly by the day, the pace of total infections and fatalities over time will have steep upward trajectories, while decreases in daily numbers leads to a flatter line.		

Does the claim that deaths from Covid-19 are still pretty flat because we've flattened the curve align with the expected outcome of public health measures designed to slow the spread of COVID-19?		
If public health measures designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 have an effect, and the number of new cases begins to fall, a plot of total infections over time would become less steep, or flatten.		

What percentage of confirmed COVID-19 cases have resulted in a death attributed to the disease?		
The case fatality rate is another key COVID-19 metric. This measure reflects the percentage of confirmed cases that have resulted in a death attributed to the disease.		

Does the number of daily Covid-19 deaths reflect changes in the number of cases?		
Fluctuations in daily deaths are a lagging indicator reflecting a preceding change in cases.		

What does the variation in COVID-19 cases and deaths among Wisconsin's 72 counties suggest about the claim that deaths from COVID-19 are still pretty flat?		
The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths varies widely among Wisconsin's 72 counties. As the pandemic has continued, daily confirmed case and death counts at the county level accumulate and highlight regional patterns of COVID-19 infections.		

Does the state's daily report of new confirmed infections and deaths indicate whether the number of Covid-19 deaths is still flat?		
The state reports new confirmed infections and deaths reported on a daily basis. If the number of new confirmed cases rises day to day, that's a sign that the outbreak is growing.		

Does the number of confirmed Covid-19 deaths in Wisconsin accurately reflect the actual number of Covid-19 deaths in the state?		
Widespread testing for COVID-19 provides another metric for understanding the spread of the disease. The total number of confirmed cases in Wisconsin is likely considerably smaller than the true number of infections.		

Does the claim that deaths from Covid-19 are still pretty flat because we've flattened the curve take into account deaths from COVID-19 that were caused by non-COVID reasons?		
Deaths among people with COVID-19 that were the result of non-COVID reasons (e.g., accident, overdose, etc.) are not included as a COVID-19 death.		

Is the total number of deaths among confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wisconsin increasing or remaining steady over time, as indicated by the graph?

A recent study found no link between the flu vaccine and COVID-19 susceptibility, morbidity or mortality.		

Does previous flu vaccination increase a person's susceptibility to COVID-19?		
In a September study published in the Journal of Clinical and Translational Science, Cleveland Clinic pulmonologist Dr. Joe Zein and colleagues found that the influenza vaccine did not increase one's susceptibility to COVID-19 nor worsen associated morbidity or mortality.		

Does the evidence suggest that previous flu vaccines increase the severity of COVID-19?		
However, based on our data, influenza vaccine is not associated with increased pandemic COVID-19 severity, providing reassurance that the vaccination strategy for global influenza should proceed as planned during the COVID-19 pandemic.		

Does the study suggest that previous flu vaccines increase the risk of contracting COVID-19?		
“The study does not show or suggest that influenza vaccination predisposes in any way, the potential for infection with the more severe forms of coronavirus, such as COVID-19,” the MHS said.		

Is there a link between President Donald Trump's past flu vaccinations and his risk of contracting COVID-19?		
Fact check: Trump's past flu vaccinations not linked to increased COVID-19 risk		

Do experts believe that previous flu vaccines increase the risk of contracting COVID-19?		
First of all, experts say there has been no study connecting the flu shot with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.		

Are there any studies that link previous flu vaccinations to an increased risk of COVID-19?		
We rate this claim FALSE because it is not supported by our research. The two studies cited in the Instagram post to support the theory that Trump's past flu vaccinations put him at an increased risk for COVID-19 have nothing to do with the virus.		

Does previous flu vaccination increase the susceptibility to COVID-19?		
Overall, our analysis demonstrates that influenza vaccination does not increase the incidence of COVID-19 or worsen the related morbidity or mortality.		

Does getting a flu vaccine increase the risk of getting COVID-19?		
There is no evidence that getting a flu vaccination increases your risk of getting sick from a coronavirus, like the one that causes COVID-19.

""The weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths,"" says co-author NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. ""		

What was the primary cause of most 1918-1919 Spanish flu deaths, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci's 2008 paper?		
The majority of deaths during the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 were not caused by the influenza virus acting alone, report researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health.		

What was the primary cause of most 1918-1919 Spanish flu deaths, according to the evidence presented?		
In the most recent influenza pandemic that did not involve the use of antibiotics to suppress bacteria (the 1918–1919 pandemic), histological and bacteriologic evidence suggests that the vast majority of influenza deaths resulted from secondary bacterial pneumonia.		

What was the primary cause of most 1918-1919 Spanish flu deaths, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci's 2008 paper?		
Conclusions: The majority of deaths in the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory-tract bacteria.		

What was the primary cause of most 1918-1919 Spanish flu deaths, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci's 2008 paper?		
Based on contemporary and modern evidence, we conclude here that influenza A virus infection in conjunction with bacterial infection led to most of the deaths during the 1918–1919 pandemic.		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's 2008 paper conclude that the majority of 1918-1919 Spanish Influenza pandemic deaths were caused by bacterial pneumonia from wearing masks?		
The question of whether the pathogenesis of severe influenza-associated pneumonia was primarily viral (i.e., assumed to be an unknown etiologic agent in 1918) or a combination of viral and bacterial agents was carefully considered by pathologists in 1918–1919, without definitive resolution [26, 33].		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's 2008 paper identify bacterial pneumonia as a cause of death in the 1918-1919 Spanish Influenza pandemic, but not specifically attribute it to wearing masks?		
Historical autopsy reports and examination of lung tissue sections from 1918 to 19 influenza case material indicated that for a significant number of patients, the cause of death was not primary viral pneumonia (Brundage and Shanks, 2008; Morens et al., 2008; Chien et al., 2009).		

What was the context of the 1918-1919 Spanish Influenza pandemic that Dr. Anthony Fauci examined in his 2008 paper?		
We examined relevant information from the most recent influenza pandemic that occurred during the era prior to the use of antibiotics, the 1918–1919 “Spanish flu” pandemic.		

What was the primary cause of most 1918-1919 Spanish flu deaths, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci's 2008 paper?		
The majority of deaths in the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory–tract bacteria.		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's 2008 paper find that wearing masks caused bacterial pneumonia to be the primary cause of deaths in the 1918-1919 Spanish Influenza pandemic?		
Interestingly, a recent study in ferrets demonstrated that the 1918 influenza virus could spread to, and induce cytokine responses in tissues outside the respiratory tract, which likely contributed to the severity of the infection (de Wit et al., 2018) and could explain the neurological complications observed during the 1918 influenza pandemic (Alexander, 1919; Ravenholt and Foege, 1982).

What was the primary cause of most 1918-1919 Spanish flu deaths, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci's research?		
The majority of deaths during the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 were not caused by the influenza virus acting alone, report researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health.		

Did Dr Anthony Fauci's paper on the 1918 pandemic mention masks as a cause of bacterial pneumonia?		
“We agree completely that bacterial pneumonia played a major role in the mortality of the 1918 pandemic,” says Anthony Fauci, director of National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease in Bethesda, Maryland, and author of another journal article out next month that comes to a similar conclusion.		

What was the cause of most deaths during the 1918-1919 Spanish Flu pandemic according to Dr. Anthony Fauci's paper?		
Many influenza experts, policy makers, and knowledgeable observers believe that a novel influenza A (H1N1) strain directly caused most deaths during the 1918–19 pandemic, often from a hemorrhagic pneumonitis that rapidly progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death (1–3).		

What was the primary cause of most 1918-1919 Spanish flu deaths, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci's paper?		
Conclusions: The majority of deaths in the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory-tract bacteria.		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's paper on the 1918-1919 Spanish Flu mention bacterial pneumonia as the primary cause of deaths?		
However, healthcare providers, medical experts, and published data from the 1918 period suggest that most deaths were caused by secondary bacterial pneumonias (5–12); hemorrhagic pneumonitis that rapidly progressed to death was considered an alarming but uncommon clinical manifestation (8,11–13).		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's paper on the Spanish Flu mention masks as a cause of bacterial pneumonia in 1918-1919?		
Moreover, the effectiveness of facemasks in preventing the transmission of influenza virus remains unclear (Cowling et al., 2010) and just as was observed in 1918, low public compliance significantly limits the utility of facemasks in a modern pandemic setting (Cowling et al., 2010).		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's paper on the 1918 flu pandemic attribute the majority of deaths to bacterial pneumonia, and if so, did he mention wearing masks as a contributing factor?		
Medical and scientific experts now agree that bacteria, not influenza viruses, were the greatest cause of death during the 1918 flu pandemic.		

Did Dr Anthony Fauci's paper suggest that wearing masks contributed to the high number of deaths in the 1918-1919 flu pandemic?		
Facemasks were a popular preventative measure employed during the 1918 pandemic. While people were unsure of the etiological agent of the pandemic, the consensus was that it was an airborne disease and wearing a facemask would prevent infections (Crosby, 1976).		

What was the likely cause of most deaths during the 1918-1919 Spanish flu pandemic, according to a 2008 study?

88,A man who received four ballot applications votes four times in the 2020 election.,"How many documented cases of voter fraud were found in the 2016 US presidential election, according to a Washington Post analysis?		
A Washington Post analysis was able to find only four documented cases of voter fraud in the 2016 election out of 135 million ballots cast.		

In the 2018 US election, how many cases of voter fraud were reported, and what types of voter fraud were involved?		
During the 2018 election, the state found that out of 3.2 million ballots cast, there were 142 cases of voter fraud — where people had either voted more than once or cast a ballot for a deceased family member.		

Is it possible for a voter to receive multiple ballot applications and subsequently cast multiple votes?		
“If someone sent in 10 requests for a mail ballot, they would receive one. In some states, that might even be against the law,” Becker said, adding that each voter has a unique voter ID number that is tied to a single ballot.		

Is it possible to cast more than one ballot in the same election?		
A: No. Once a voter casts a ballot, the voter cannot cast another ballot. Attempting to vote more than once in the same election is a felony.		

Are all ballots cast in the 2020 election, including those that were not counted, accounted for by election officials?		
- Although only valid ballots should be counted in determining the results of the election, election officials should account for all ballots cast in the election, including unused, sample, challenged, spoiled, and totally void ballots.		

If a man who received four ballot applications voted four times in the 2020 election, how many votes may have been affected by this action?		
7. Determine how many votes may have been affected if the allegation is true, which in this example would be the total number of retired members who improperly voted in the election.		

What measures are in place to prevent someone from casting multiple votes in an election if they receive multiple ballot applications?		
Because absentee ballots and early voting ballots are retrievable, if someone tries to get around the system, their ballot can be retrieved and not counted, so it will not affect the outcome of an election.		

Is there any evidence that the man who received four ballot applications actually voted in the 2020 election?		
4. Review election records, such as the voter eligibility list and voter register, to determine if the retired members cited by the protesting member and any other retired members actually voted in the election.		

What action will election officials take if a person receives multiple ballot applications?		
In such cases election officials may decide that they do not have to pursue the allegation further. However, in most instances you will probably need to take further action (such as reviewing union records or talking to individuals who can provide necessary information) in order to resolve the protest.		

Is it possible for a person to vote multiple times in the 2020 US presidential election using mail-in ballots?		
“The way it works is, people can no more vote multiple mail ballots than they could go into various different polling places on Election Day and try to vote,” said David Becker, founder of the Center for Election Innovation and Research.

89,"Most deaths in the 1918 influenza pandemic originated from bacterial pneumonia caused by face masks and that Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government’s top expert in the fight against Covid-19, knew about it.","Did Dr. Anthony Fauci claim that face masks caused bacterial pneumonia in the 1918 influenza pandemic?		
In the most recent influenza pandemic that did not involve the use of antibiotics to suppress bacteria (the 1918–1919 pandemic), histological and bacteriologic evidence suggests that the vast majority of influenza deaths resulted from secondary bacterial pneumonia.		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's statement support the claim that most deaths in the 1918 influenza pandemic originated from bacterial pneumonia caused by face masks?		
""The weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths,"" says co-author NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. ""		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci state that face masks caused bacterial pneumonia in the majority of 1918 influenza pandemic deaths?		
The majority of deaths during the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 were not caused by the influenza virus acting alone, report researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health.		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci attribute the majority of 1918-1919 influenza pandemic deaths to bacterial pneumonia caused by face masks?		
The majority of deaths in the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory–tract bacteria.		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci claim that face masks caused bacterial pneumonia in the 1918 influenza pandemic?		
Although the cause of influenza was disputed in 1918, there was almost universal agreement among experts [e.g., 20, 27–33] that deaths were virtually never caused by the unidentified etiologic agent itself, but resulted directly from severe secondary pneumonia caused by well-known bacterial “pneumopathogens” that colonized the upper respiratory tract (predominantly pneumococci, streptococci, and staphylococci).		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci's evidence suggest that the 1918 influenza pandemic deaths were primarily caused by a combination of viral and bacterial agents, rather than solely by bacterial pneumonia caused by face masks?		
The question of whether the pathogenesis of severe influenza-associated pneumonia was primarily viral (i.e., assumed to be an unknown etiologic agent in 1918) or a combination of viral and bacterial agents was carefully considered by pathologists in 1918–1919, without definitive resolution [26, 33].		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci attribute the majority of 1918-1919 flu deaths to bacterial pneumonia caused by face masks?		
Based on contemporary and modern evidence, we conclude here that influenza A virus infection in conjunction with bacterial infection led to most of the deaths during the 1918–1919 pandemic.		

What was the primary cause of most 1918 influenza pandemic deaths, according to Dr. Morens?		
The published reports ""clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory flora in most influenza fatalities,"" says Dr. Morens.		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci attribute the majority of 1918 influenza pandemic deaths to bacterial pneumonia caused by face masks?		
We examined relevant information from the most recent influenza pandemic that occurred during the era prior to the use of antibiotics, the 1918–1919 “Spanish flu” pandemic.		

Did Dr. Anthony Fauci state that the 1918 influenza pandemic deaths were caused by bacterial pneumonia, and if so, did he mention a specific cause for this bacterial pneumonia?		
[20, 30, 32]. The pneumonia deaths during the influenza pandemic in 1918 proved so highly similar, pathologically, to the then-recent pneumonia deaths from the measles epidemics that noted experts considered them to be the result of one newly emerging disease: epidemic bacterial pneumonia precipitated by prevalent respiratory tract agents [20, 33, 63].

115,More people who wear masks become sick with COVID-19 compared to non-mask wearers,"Do comparative studies show that people who wear masks are more likely to become sick with COVID-19 compared to those who do not wear masks?		
Even the cautious and consensus-driven World Health Organization, which initially recommended against masks, now encourages their use in areas of widespread COVID-19 transmission137, in light of new information on the disease and the results of large-scale comparative studies135.		

Does wearing a mask reduce the transmission of COVID-19?		
- There is now convincing evidence from multiple controlled experiments5–7 and field observations8–14 that wearing masks reduces the transmission of COVID-19 for healthcare workers and the public.		

Does wearing a mask slow the spread of COVID-19?		
This is not true. A very recent systematic review by Macintyre and Chughtai7 of public masking studies (including many RCTs) concluded that masks are effective at slowing the spread of many respiratory diseases.		

Does wearing masks reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19?		
Sweeping mask recommendations—as many have proposed—will not reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, as evidenced by the widespread practice of wearing such masks in Hubei province, China, before and during its mass COVID-19 transmission experience earlier this year.		

Does wearing a face mask increase the risk of contracting COVID-19?		
The secondary attack rate among health care workers who unknowingly care for a patient with COVID-19 while wearing face masks alone or not using any personal protective equipment is also low; transmission studies suggest less than 3% (and the few health care worker infections that were documented in these transmission studies were associated with aerosol-generating procedures or prolonged exposures with inconsistent use of face masks).5,6 People infected with SARS-CoV-2 may be producing both droplets and aerosols on a constant basis but most of these emissions are not infecting other people.		

Does wearing a mask appear to increase or decrease the risk of becoming sick with COVID-19?		
There is also recent evidence that masking is effective at state and national levels. In countries where public masking was common before the pandemic (where it was culturally normal for sick people to wear masks in public), COVID-19 had an initial daily growth rate of 10%, versus 18% in countries without such norms10,61,62.		

In the study that linked universal masking to stopping the exponential growth of COVID-19 cases, how many participants were involved?		
This large study involved 75,000 participants, including healthcare workers and patients. Of all the public health interventions, universal masking appears to be the most associated with stopping the exponential growth of COVID-19 cases, first flattening and then decreasing the infection rate8.		

Does wearing a mask increase the risk of contracting COVID-19?		
However, recent studies have shown decreased cases of COVID-19 in areas where masks and social distancing are mandated, and experts say that the efficacy of these mandates will only increase over time13,14,23,77.		

In the study referenced in the evidence, what was the relationship between mask use and the incidence of COVID-19?

Biden’s campaign has focused on a short video clip circulated by the Sanders campaign of a Biden speech in 2018 in which he appears to express praise for former House Speaker Paul Ryan’s tax plan passed during Trump’s presidency — words that the Biden campaign says were delivered sarcastically.		

What did Joe Biden say about his campaign and his political affiliation?		
Given the way certain phrases were delivered and a fuller context of Biden’s comments, it was misleading for a Sanders campaign staffer to claim that Biden said “‘Ryan was correct’ to go after Social Security & Medicare.”

What position does Joe Biden claim to hold in the statement ""You know, we have to come together. That’s why I’m running. I’m running as a proud Democrat for the Senate. So vote! Vote!""?		
Sanders argues that position is at odds with Biden’s past positions. Biden has been in government a long time — he was elected to the Senate in 1972 — and so he has a long legislative record and numerous publicly documented positions on these programs.		

Who was the actual source of the statement ""You know, we have to come together. That’s why I’m running. I’m running as a proud Democrat for the Senate. So vote! Vote!""?		
AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. Biden was not making the statement himself, he was reading a racist statement made by a state legislator during a redistricting process in Louisiana that was overseen by a deputy attorney general nominee.

Today – nearly 50 years later – as Pope Francis prepares to speak to six astronauts currently on the International Space Station on Oct. 26, it’s a good moment to look back at when popes sent prayers and tokens beyond Earth’s stratosphere, and the times when little pieces of the cosmos, taken from the unknown boundaries of space, made it back.

Does the Pope's blessing of NASA's astronauts imply that NASA requires the Pope's or God's permission before conducting space missions?

Does the Pope always bless NASA's space missions before they depart?		
Paul VI had blessed the voyage of Apollo 11 on its departure on July 16, kept them in his prayers, and referred to the mission often during his weekly general audiences.		

Did the Pope prepare a set of questions for astronauts on a wide range of topics, including faith?		
Benedict XVI prepared a set of questions in English for the astronauts on a wide range of topics including the environment, war and faith.		

Did the Pope send a blessing to NASA before the Apollo 11 mission?

Does NASA receive a blessing from the Pope before a space mission?		
As they departed on their historic voyage, the astronauts were carrying goodwill messages, including one from the pope praying “for this wonderful beginning,” and quoting Psalm 8 praising, “Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!”		

Did the Pope have any involvement with NASA in 2011?		
In 2011, Benedict XVI became the first pope to speak to astronauts in space. Sitting in the Vatican Library in Rome, the pope video-called Italian astronauts Paolo Nespoli and Roberto Vittori aboard the International Space Station, who were accompanied by ten other crewmembers from a U.S. and Russian space station.

The ""Flora and Fauna Act"" myth is a belief often repeated in public debate that Indigenous Australians were classified as fauna by legislation, specifically under a “Flora and Fauna Act”, and managed as such by the Australian and State Governments, and that the legislation and practice was overturned by a change to the Australian Constitution implemented by the 1967 referendum about Aboriginal affairs.

Did Robert E. Lee own slaves?		
Robert E. Lee personally owned slaves that he inherited upon the death of his mother, Ann Lee, in 1829.		

Did Robert E. Lee own slaves?

Did Robert E. Lee own slaves?		
Lee’s cruelty as a slave master was not confined to physical punishment. In Reading the Man, the historian Elizabeth Brown Pryor’s portrait of Lee through his writings, Pryor writes that “Lee ruptured the Washington and Custis tradition of respecting slave families” by hiring them off to other plantations, and that “by 1860 he had broken up every family but one on the estate, some of whom had been together since Mount Vernon days.”		

Did Robert E. Lee have a family connection to slave-holding families?		
A career army officer, Lee didn't have much wealth, but he inherited a few slaves from his mother. Still, Lee married into one of the wealthiest slave-holding families in Virginia — the Custis family of Arlington and descendants of Martha Washington.

Did Ulysses S. Grant own any slaves at some point in his life?		
At some time before the Civil War, Grant himself owned a slave named William Jones.

Did Ulysses S. Grant ever own a slave?

Did Ulysses S. Grant own slaves?

135,No one lost their health care because of the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill.,"What type of health insurance policies were allowed to be sold in Iowa under the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill?		
The Iowa situation became even more complicated this spring, when Iowa legislators approved a controversial plan to let Wellmark partner with the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation to sell 2019 policies that don’t comply with Affordable Care Act regulations or state rules.		

What was the reason given by Wellmark for pulling out of the Iowa health insurance market?		
When Wellmark, Iowa’s Blue Cross Blue Shield provider, announced that it would pull out of the markets for next year, it also revealed that one enrollee with a rare genetic disease costs more than $1 million a month to treat.		

Did Wellmark Blue Cross initially withdraw from the Iowa health insurance market?		
This left Medica and Wellmark Blue Cross. Initially, Wellmark remained out of the Iowa market but as other insurers withdrew, it decided to enter for 2017.		

Did the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill allow for the sale of unregulated policies that technically aren’t health insurance?		
Medica objected to the bill allowing Wellmark and Farm Bureau to sell unregulated policies that technically aren’t health insurance.		

Did the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill lead to any changes in health insurance coverage in Iowa?		
The situation in Iowa has improved, however. Wellmark reentered the market for 2019, noting that legislative and regulatory uncertainty has ""dissipated just enough that we think we're able to step back in,"" as long as ""there aren't any significant changes to the ACA"" (Ramm 2018).		

Did any insurance companies withdraw from the Iowa health insurance market due to the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill?		
In Iowa, for instance, several sources noted that insurers were nervous about being in a market where cost-sharing payments were being used as a political bargaining chip, but Medica, now the state's only insurer, decided not to withdraw after the insurance department allowed it to file contingency (backup) rates.		

Did the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan result in any Farm Bureau members losing their healthcare coverage?		
Farm Bureau members who live in Iowa now have access to an affordable healthcare option. Farm Bureau Health Plan offers comprehensive benefits and a broad provider network at rates that could save you as much as 50% compared to other plans available in the market.		

What was the reason behind Wellmark's decision to reenter the Iowa health insurance market?		
Informed speculation also suggests that Wellmark's reentry decision was tied to the state's decision to allow it to start selling non-ACA-compliant coverage through the Farm Bureau.		

What happens to the disincentive to purchase Farm Bureau plans in Tennessee and Iowa in 2019?		
However, this disincentive to purchase Farm Bureau plans in Tennessee and Iowa will end in 2019 when repeal of the mandate penalty takes effect.

137,it is unknown whether a person under 20 can pass the disease to an older adult.,"Can a person under 20 pass the COVID-19 virus to an older adult, even if the younger person does not show symptoms of the disease?		
The extent of truly asymptomatic infection in the community remains unknown. The proportion of people whose infection is asymptomatic likely varies with age due to the increasing prevalence of underlying conditions in older age groups (and thus increasing risk of developing severe disease with increasing age), and studies that show that children are less likely to show clinical symptoms compared to adults.(76)		

Can a person under 20 years old transmit the SARS-COV-2 virus to an older adult?		
However, it is highly likely that children can transmit the SARS-COV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, and even asymptomatic children can have viral loads.		

Can a person under 20 pass COVID-19 to an older adult?		
People of any age can catch COVID-19. But it most commonly affects middle-aged and older adults. The risk of developing dangerous symptoms increases with age, with those who are age 85 and older are at the highest risk of serious symptoms.		

How much is it understood about the transmission of the disease from people who are infected but remain asymptomatic?		
Transmission can also occur from people who are infected and remain asymptomatic, but the extent to which this occurs is not fully understood and requires further research as an urgent priority.		

Is it known whether a person under 20 can pass the disease to an older adult?		
While someone who never develops symptoms can also pass the virus to others, it is still not clear to what extent this occurs and more research is needed in this area.		

Can a person under 20 pass the disease to an older adult?		
An increase in the percentage of positive test results in older age groups is likely to result in more hospitalizations, severe illnesses, and deaths.¶ These findings corroborate regional patterns in the southern United States, where increased percent positivity among adults aged 20–39 years preceded increases among those aged ≥60 years (2); provide evidence that among young adults, those aged 18–24 years demonstrate the earliest increases in percent positivity; and underscore the importance of reducing transmission from younger populations to those at highest risk for severe illness or death.		

What do detailed contact tracing efforts and epidemiologic investigations reveal about the transmission of the disease from people under 20 to older adults?		
Transmission from infected people without symptoms is difficult to study. However, information can be gathered from detailed contact tracing efforts, as well as epidemiologic investigations among cases and contacts.		

Is there an increase in COVID-19 incidence among young adults that suggests they may be able to pass the disease to older adults?		
There is an urgent need to address transmission among young adult populations, especially given recent increases in COVID-19 incidence among young adults (3).		

What aspects of Covid-19 transmission are still being researched to gain a better understanding of the disease?		
As research continues, we expect to gain a better understanding about the relative importance of different transmission routes, including through droplets, physical contact and fomites; the role of airborne transmission in the absence of aerosol generating procedures; the dose of virus required for transmission to occur, the characteristics of people and situations that facilitate superspreading events such as those observed in various closed settings, the proportion of infected people who remain asymptomatic throughout the course of their infection; the proportion of truly asymptomatic persons who transmit the virus to others; the specific factors that drive asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission; and the proportion of all infections that are transmitted from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals.		

Are people under 20 with symptoms more likely to transmit COVID-19 to an older adult than those under 20 who are asymptomatic?		
Information from contact tracing efforts reported to WHO by Member States, available transmission studies and a recent pre-print systematic reviews suggests that individuals without symptoms are less likely to transmit the virus than those who develop symptoms.(10, 81, 84, 85) Four individual studies from Brunei, Guangzhou China, Taiwan China and the Republic of Korea found that between 0% and 2.2% of people with asymptomatic infection infected anyone else, compared to 0.8%-15.4% of people with symptoms.(10, 72, 86, 87)

In a highly anticipated report released Monday, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz determined that the FBI had adequate cause in July 2016 to justify opening an investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia and did not find hard evidence of political bias in that decision, undermining allegations by President Trump and his allies that the bureau acted improperly in launching the probe.

While CO2 can build up in face masks, it is unlikely that wearing a mask will cause hypercapnia, according to the CDC		

Can wearing face masks increase the risk of carbon dioxide intoxication in individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions?

176,Tax avoidance costs £90 billion per year.,"How much more than the £1.7 billion estimated by HMRC do the figures suggest tax avoidance costs annually?		
These figures are outside the scope of HMRC estimates. How much more is there? It’s hard to say. But if HMRC say that there are avoidance costs of at least £1.7bn in previous reports - which will not include the above two figures for reasons already noted.		

What portion of the £90 billion tax gap is attributed to tax avoidance, as opposed to other reasons such as non-payment of declared tax or errors?		
Then add in HMRC’s admitted rate of non-payment of £3.4 billion, which is tax declared but not paid, and the £3.2 billion not paid due to errors, which would not show up in shadow economy data as this relates to declared activity.		

Does the HMRC consider the tax gap of 9.8% in 2015 to be significant?		
HMRC said that in 2015, the year to which my data relates, the VAT tax gap was 9.8%. I think we can agree that the difference is pretty insignificant.		

What is the estimated annual cost of tax avoidance in the UK according to the given evidence?		
Based on the work of Alex Cobham and Peter Jansky, in turn based on IMF based estimates, corporate profit shifting from the UK may be a surprisingly low £1 billion a year (other countries, like Germany and France, suffer a great deal more).		

What is the estimated range of the tax gap based on the shadow economy?		
The resulting tax gap due to the shadow economy was, based on a euro UK GDP of €2,602bn, between £60.2bn and £66.7bn.		

Does the figure of £90 billion refer to tax evasion, or does it include other factors as well?		
Based on his work I have estimated that evasion by the very wealthiest in the UK may amount to up to £7 billion a year.		

What factors are included in the estimate of tax avoidance costs of £90 billion per year?		
So HMRC audit inefficiency is built into the estimates as a result. And third, they simply ignore the fact that 800,000 or so income tax returns and at least 400,000 corporation tax returns are simply not submitted each year: the estimates for losses from these are negligible but, most especially with regard to companies may well account for a considerable part of the tax evaded.		

What work did you do for the European Union Socialists and Democrats group of MEPs in the EU parliament that led to an alternative estimate of the UK tax gap?		
So let me suggest an alternative estimate of the UK tax gap in advance of HMRC's claim. This is based on the work I did for the European Union Socialists and Democrats group of MEPs in the EU parliament published in January this year, here.		

What does HMRC's estimate of the VAT gap tend to be based on?		
Let me summarise why. First, HMRC's estimate of the VAT gap tends to be sound: it is based on macroeconomic data.		

Is the claim that tax avoidance costs £90 billion per year consistent with the evidence provided?		
I can make a fairly confident prediction. The figure will be around £33 billion, simply because ever since this data was first published in 2010 the tax gap has never been below £27 billion and has never gone above £35 billion.

183,"Mexico on a ""red alert"" with children being targeted for kidnapping so their organs can be harvested","What types of abuses have Mexican security forces committed in the context of counternarcotics operations?		
A principal finding of our report is that Mexican security forces have committed widespread abuses in the context of counternarcotics operations, including the systematic use of torture in five states.		

What evidence has Human Rights Watch documented regarding disappearances in Mexico?		
Human Rights Watch has documented 249 disappearances committed in Mexico since December 2006. In 149 of these cases, we found compelling evidence that state actors participated in the crime, either acting on their own or collaborating with criminal groups.		

Have there been reports of disappearances in Mexico that could be linked to criminal groups?		
Given that cartels have committed serious crimes in Mexico in recent years, including many disappearances, it is reasonable for prosecutors to investigate the possibility that the perpetrators of such crimes are members of criminal groups.		

Is the entire country of Mexico on a ""red alert"" due to children being targeted for kidnapping so their organs can be harvested?		
Yet the report does not purport to comment on the “entire” country. Rather, it addresses abuses in the context of President Calderón’s “war on drugs” (which has affected some regions of the country significantly more than others), based on findings from five of the states where federal security forces have undertaken some of their largest interventions, and which account for 43 percent of drug-related violence in the country (according to the most recent available official statistics).		

Are Mexican security forces implicated in grave abuses, including cases of kidnapping?		
[488] We disagree. Our report documents more than 230 cases in which Mexican security forces are implicated in grave abuses—including cases from five different states, and cases involving every type of security force involved in counternarcotics operations (the Army, Navy, and the federal, state, and local police).		

Are there any indications of state involvement in the alleged organ harvesting kidnappings in Mexico?		
We are not aware of evidence of the participation of state actors in these crimes. However, given the widespread involvement of police and military personnel evidenced in other disappearances, in the absence of thorough investigations, it is impossible to rule out the participation of state actors in these cases.		

Is there evidence to support the claim that children in Mexico are being targeted for kidnapping to have their organs harvested?		
None of the victims lived in Miguel Alemán.[30]Moreover, it is a city notorious for being one of the most violent in the state (for example, there were several public shootouts involving the military and armed criminal groups shortly before this incident), and for having a significant presence of organized crime groups, in particular the Zetas.[31]		

Does Mexico have any international obligations to protect individuals who report disappearances, including those of children?		
Mexico has obligations under the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance to ensure not only the right to report the facts of a disappearance to the competent authorities and a prompt, thorough impartial investigation of the report, but also to take measures to protect anyone—including the complainant—participating in the investigation, from any ill-treatment or intimidation as a consequence of the complaint.[273]		

Is there a legal framework in place in Mexico to investigate and prosecute cases of enforced disappearances, particularly those involving children?		
Furthermore, Mexico’s Military Code of Justice does not criminalize enforced disappearances. Because cases of alleged disappearances perpetrated by the military in Mexico are virtually always investigated in the military justice system, this absence results in a serious gap in relevant legislation.[449]		

Are the disappearances of children in Mexico being reported to the authorities, and if so, what is the response of the authorities to these reports?		
And when families report disappearances, they are subject to threats and attacks, particularly in cases where evidence points to the involvement of members of the military and police.

191,Flu shots lead to severe or life-threatening conditions making them unsafe.,"Does the flu shot increase the risk of severe or life-threatening conditions?		
No. Studies show that the flu shot does not cause an increased risk for miscarriage. This comes from one of the largest studies examining influenza vaccination and the risk of miscarriage conducted by the CDC in 2019.		

Do the benefits of flu shots outweigh the risks of severe or life-threatening conditions?		
The potential benefits of influenza vaccination in preventing serious illness, hospitalization, and death substantially outweigh these estimates of risk for vaccine-associated GBS.		

Does the current evidence support a causal link between flu shots and severe or life-threatening conditions?		
While the weight of epidemiologic evidence does not support a causal link between influenza vaccinations evaluated over the last 30 years, an association cannot be confidently ruled out, particularly for future vaccine strains.		

Does the evidence suggest that flu shots increase the risk of severe or life-threatening conditions?		
The authors concluded that vaccination against influenza does not increase the risk of GBS incidence within 42 days of immunization, but noted the study was underpowered to assess a small increase in the background incidence.		

Does flu vaccination increase the risk of severe or life-threatening conditions, specifically Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)?		
Whether influenza vaccination specifically might increase the risk for recurrence of GBS is unknown.

For example, the CDC reports that vaccination has been shown to cut the risk of pregnant women developing flu-associated acute respiratory illnesses by about one-half.		

Did the study find that flu shots are associated with an increased risk of severe or life-threatening conditions?		
The authors concluded that influenza vaccination is not associated with an increased risk of GBS in adults; however, they noted that this association was not the primary goal of the study.		

What is the risk of developing a severe or life-threatening condition, such as Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), after receiving a flu shot?		
It’s possible that the flu vaccine, including FluMist, can increase your risk for developing GBS. However, this risk is very small: about a 0.0001% increased risk.		

What are the potential risks associated with flu shots?		
Although data are limited, the established benefits of influenza vaccination might outweigh the risks for many persons who have a history of GBS and who also are at high risk for severe complications from influenza.

While the quote included in the Facebook meme is largely accurate, the word “it’s” in Ms Collins’ debate response – a reference to Mr Trump’s record in initiating wars – has been replaced with “he’s”, wrongly implying that the National leader said the current US president was better than all those before him.

Therefore, COVID-19 can spread quickly in these communities, and the impact of that spread is great. Testing, particularly of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals, is key to interrupting this spread.		

Will stopping COVID-19 testing lead to a decrease in the spread of the virus?		
Testing of all people for SARS-CoV-2, including those who have no symptoms, who show symptoms of infection such as trouble breathing, fever, sore throat or loss of the sense of smell and taste, and who may have been exposed to the virus will help prevent the spread of COVID-19 by identifying people who are in need of care in a timely fashion.		

What is the claimant's stance on the effectiveness of COVID-19 testing and vaccination in preventing the spread of the virus?		
Also, vaccination can prevent severe illness from COVID-19. But misinformation continues to circulate about COVID-19 vaccines and ways to prevent infection with the COVID-19 virus.		

Is the claim that COVID-19 will go away if people stop getting tested supported by the fact that COVID-19 was a federal public health emergency in the United States from January 2020 until May 2023?		
COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus. Scientists first identified this virus in December 2019. From January 2020 until May 2023, COVID-19 was a federal public health emergency in the United States.		

Does the claim that Covid-19 will go away if you stop getting tested align with the fact that nearly half of all SARS-CoV-2 infections are transmitted by people who are not showing any symptoms?		
Since it is recognized that nearly half of all SARS-CoV-2 infections are transmitted by people who are not showing any symptoms, identifying infected individuals while they are presymptomatic, as well as those who are asymptomatic, will play a major role in stopping the pandemic.		

Will stopping COVID-19 testing lead to the virus going away?		
Testing can help people determine if they are infected with SARS-CoV-2 – regardless of whether they have symptoms – and whether they are at risk of spreading the infection to others.		

Does the claim that COVID-19 will go away if people stop getting tested contradict the fact that anyone can get COVID-19, regardless of their likelihood of getting severely ill?		
Anyone can get COVID-19. However, some people are more likely than others to get very sick if they get COVID-19.		

What are the potential health consequences of COVID-19 infection, even in individuals who are not elderly?		
- Getting sick with COVID-19 can cause severe illness or death, even in children, but it is not possible to determine who will experience mild or severe illness from COVID-19 infection.		

What are the potential risks and complications associated with COVID-19?		
COVID-19 can have serious, life-threatening complications and there is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you.		

Does the claimant believe that the number of reported Covid-19 cases is artificially inflated due to testing?

- Requires the Departments of State and Health and Human Services to implement a balanced approach to address the Pan American Health Organization’s role in the Mais Médicos program—mandating transparency and accountability, preventing future support for Cuban medical missions, and ensuring PAHO has necessary funding to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and other health needs in the region.

- Recognizes evidence that the Cuban regime’s deployment of Cuban doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as through the Mais Médicos program in Brazil between 2013 and 2018, constitute human trafficking, and documents concerns by the UN Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery and the UN Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons.		

What are the concerns of the United States over Cuba's cooperation in the 'More Doctors' program, specifically regarding the autonomy and wages of the Cuban medical professionals involved?		
There is some suggestion, for example, that these doctors may not have autonomous decision-making regarding whether they want to deploy on these international missions, but rather are forced to do so by the government.24 Recent legal proceedings in Brazil, moreover, have sought to show that the Cuban model of exporting physicians for economic gain violates the International Labour Organization’s agreement on the protection of wages.24 This is based on the findings from the Mais Medicos programme that suggest that Cuban medics received significantly less in wages than their international counterparts, with the majority of the wages paid directly by Brazil to Cuba for its doctors being retained by the Cuban state.23 24		

What are the motivations behind Cuba's international medical missions, such as the 'More Doctors' program?		
Recent media coverage of the closure of the Mais Medicos programme20 in Brazil has focused on the political determinants of these overseas medical missions, where Cuban doctors are sent to provide healthcare in exchange for oil or hard currency.12 21 Political motivations have also been suggested as standing behind Cuba’s provision of over half of the medical professionals for Mission Barrio Adentro in Venezuela, Chavez’s (now failing) health and social welfare programmes focused on delivering universal healthcare across poorer neighbourhoods.22 Such activities have spurred discussion on the motivation for this Cuban international activity, whether driven by international prestige,14 goodwill, soft power,12 solidarity13 or economic gain.23 Cuba’s medical missions have also been criticised for violating the (labour) rights of those deployed.		

What are the concerns of the United States about the 'More Doctors' program, according to José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch?		
“Cuban doctors deployed to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic provide valuable services to many communities, but at the expense of their most basic freedoms,” said José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch.		

What are the global health security contributions of Cuba that may be relevant to the discussion of its cooperation in the 'More Doctors' program at PAHO?		
Cuba’s activities in global health security speak directly to these debates. Indeed, Cuba has made considerable strides in infectious disease control, comparable to that of high-income countries, doing so in a low-income setting beleaguered by a struggling economy, and facing resource and access challenges from the US embargo.		

What are the challenges facing the Cuban healthcare system?		
Of course, the Cuban health-care system faces big challenges. ""The biggest challenge is lack of access to pharmaceuticals and technology, largely because of the U.S. embargo,"" says Diane Appelbaum, RN, who directs the Community Partnerships for Health Equity program at MEDICC (Medical Education Cooperation with Cuba), a nonprofit group that works to enhance cooperation among U.S., Cuban and global health professionals as a way to improve health and equity.		

What are the challenges facing Cuba's health security?		
Health security in Cuba, however, also faces challenges. These concern Cuba’s visibility and participation in the broader global health security architecture, the social controls exercised by the state in managing disease threats in Cuban territory, and the resource constraints facing the island—in particular, the effects of the US embargo.		

What is the nature of the cooperation between Cuba and PAHO that led to the signing of an agreement to supply physicians to priority municipalities in Brazil?		
With the assistance of the Pan American Health Organization, an agreement was signed with the Cuban government to supply physicians with primary health-care experience.19 Cuban physicians were sent to priority municipalities, usually remote places, which had not been chosen by Brazilian doctors.		

What are the concerns of the United States over Cuba's cooperation in the 'More Doctors' program?		
These services have produced world-leading health outcomes and demonstrate what is possible to accomplish in a resource-poor setting, allowing Cuba to demonstrate a strong domestic health security position, although the veracity of some of these claims has been disputed.27 In particular, critiques have highlighted that the Cuban image of a high-performing system appears to be almost exclusively based on infant mortality rates—an explicit point of focus of Cuban government policy—at the cost of other health indicators, including maternal mortality, disability, disease exposure and life expectancy, and underinvestment in the social determinants of health more broadly.27 28

What was the ratio of police officers to residents in New Zealand during Ms Collins' time as police minister?		
Ms Collins, who was police minister under the previous National government between November 2008 and December 2011 and again from December 2015 to December 2016, admitted in August 2016 her government had not kept up with its target of one officer for every 500 people living in New Zealand.		

Did the number of police officers increase or decrease overall during Judith Collins' time as police minister?		
While there were some year-on-year decreases in the number of police officers during Ms Collins’ stints as police minister, officer numbers increased overall by 688.		

How many police officers were there in June 2008 when Ms Collins became police minister?		
According to NZ Police, in June 2008, there were 8,211 police officers. Ms Collins first became police minister in November 2008.		

How does the ratio of police officers to the resident population change during Judith Collins' second run as police minister?		
However, during Ms Collins’ second run as police minister, population growth in NZ largely outstripped the growth in police numbers (1/514 in 2015 to 1/526 in 2016).		

Does the officer to resident ratio improve during Ms Collins' first period as police minister?		
When police numbers are described as an officer to resident ratio, they show an improvement during Ms Collins’ first period as police minister (from 1/519 in 2008, to 1/507 in 2011).		

How many police officers were there in June 2016 when Ms Collins' portfolios changed in December 2016?		
There were 8,923 police officers in June 2015 and this dropped to 8,899 in June 2016. Ms Collins portfolios changed again in December 2016.		

Does the evidence support the claim that the number of police decline when National Party leader Judith Collins’ was police minister, when considering the ratio of police to the resident population?		
This means NZ Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is only correct to say police numbers fell under Judith Collins when those figures are expressed as police per head of population.		

How many police officers were in June 2011 when Ms Collins' portfolio changed?		
The NZ Police figures show officer numbers then rose to 8,643 in June 2009 and 8,707 in June 2010, before dropping to 8,638 in June 2011.

Coal use is projected to decline until the 2030s as regions replace coal with natural gas and renewables		

Does Judith Collins' claim that New Zealand is using more coal to generate electricity because of the oil and gas exploration ban align with the trend of increasing renewable energy sources in New Zealand?		
This investment is contributing to a changing energy mix in Australia. Over the past decade, the share of electricity generation from renewable sources has increased steadily to be nearly 20 per cent in 2018 (Graph 1).[1]		

What impact has the oil and gas exploration ban had on New Zealand's electricity generation mix?		
This has slowed the transition towards a clean electricity system. Despite the impressive growth of solar and wind power, the overall share of clean energy sources in total electricity supply in 2018, at 36%, was the same as it was 20 years earlier because of the decline in nuclear.		

Does Judith Collins' statement that New Zealand is using more coal to generate electricity because of the oil and gas exploration ban align with the expected long-term transition towards renewable energy?		
In the longer term, the transition towards renewable energy is expected to continue. Significant coal-fired generation capacity will be retired over coming decades and is likely to be replaced mainly by distributed energy resources and large-scale renewable energy generators, supported by energy storage.		

Is Judith Collins' statement that New Zealand is using more coal to generate electricity because of the oil and gas exploration ban supported by the trend in energy generation in Australia?		
Renewable energy investment has increased significantly in Australia over recent years, contributing to a continuing shift in the energy generation mix away from traditional fossil fuel sources.		

Is New Zealand's share of global electricity supply increasing?		
However, its share of global electricity supply has been declining in recent years. That has been driven by advanced economies, where nuclear fleets are ageing, additions of new capacity have dwindled to a trickle, and some plants built in the 1970s and 1980s have been retired.

241,President Joe Biden is abusing the prescription drug Adderall.,"Is there any evidence that President Joe Biden is using the prescription drug Adderall?		
There’s no evidence to suggest Biden is actually on any drugs, legal or otherwise. But purely hypothetically: Would Adderall really do what Giuliani (and by implication, Trump) claims?		

Is there evidence that President Joe Biden is being prescribed Adderall for ADHD, or is the claim that he is abusing the prescription drug unfounded?		
The widespread use of prescription stimulants for ADHD has not been without critics. In recent months, we have heard speculation about whether ADHD is a real disease, and if it is real, whether it is being grossly over-diagnosed.

242,"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention downgrades COVID-19, rating it less fatal than seasonal flu","Does the number of COVID-19 deaths in the US as of the end of April 2020 suggest that COVID-19 is less fatal than seasonal flu?		
Based on the figure of approximately 60 000 COVID-19 deaths in the US as of the end of April 2020, this ratio suggests only a 1.0-fold to 2.6-fold change from the CDC-estimated seasonal influenza deaths calculated during the previous 7 full seasons.3 From our analysis, we infer that either the CDC’s annual estimates substantially overstate the actual number of deaths caused by influenza or that the current number of COVID-19 counted deaths substantially understates the actual number of deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2, or both.		

Does the CDC rate COVID-19 as less fatal than the flu, according to Dr. Fauci's statement?		
Fauci said COVID-19 is at least 10 times ""more lethal"" than the seasonal flu, even if the mortality rate drops far below the World Health Organization's current estimate of 3.4%.		

Does the CDC conclude that COVID-19 is more lethal than seasonal flu?		
The adjusted mortality rate from coronavirus of 1% was then compared with the 0.1% mortality rate from seasonal influenza, and the conclusion was reported to the House Committee that the coronavirus was 10-times more lethal than seasonal influenza.		

How does the number of COVID-19 deaths compare to the number of influenza deaths according to the CDC's provisional counts?		
The CDC also publishes provisional counts of COVID-19 deaths but acknowledges that its reporting lags behind other public data sources.7 For the week ending April 11, 2020, data indicate that the number of provisionally reported COVID-19 deaths was 14.4-fold greater than influenza deaths during the apparent peak week of the current season (week ending February 29, 2020), consistent with the ranges based on CDC statistics.6 As the CDC continues to revise its COVID-19 counts to account for delays in reporting, the ratio of counted COVID-19 deaths to influenza deaths is likely to increase.		

What is the mortality rate of COVID-19 according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)?		
In a comparative analysis with WHO and CDC documents, the coronavirus mortality rate of 2-3% that was adjusted to 1% in Congressional testimony is consistent with the coronavirus CFR of 1.8-3.4% (median, 2.6%) reported by the CDC.13		

Does the COVID-19 virus have a similar mortality rate to the H1N1 influenza virus of 1918?		
Furthermore, the WHO reported that the CFR of the H1N1 influenza virus (1918) is also 2-3%,14 similar to the unadjusted 2-3% CFR of the coronavirus reported in Congressional testimony, with no meaningful difference in mortality.		

Does the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rate COVID-19 as less fatal than the seasonal flu?		
- Fauci said the coronavirus is 10 times deadlier than the seasonal flu, which has a 0.1 percent mortality rate.		

How does the case fatality rate of COVID-19 compare to that of seasonal flu in the United States?		
For comparison, the case fatality rate with seasonal flu in the United States is less than 0.1% (1 death per every 1,000 cases).		

Did the CDC's adjustment of the COVID-19 mortality rate affect the comparison of its fatality rate to that of seasonal flu?		
Had the adjusted coronavirus mortality rate not been lowered from 3% to 1%, fatality comparisons of the coronavirus to the IFR of seasonal influenza would have increased from 10-times higher to 20- to 30-times higher.		

How many flu deaths did the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate occurred during the current flu season?		
(During the current flu season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there have been 39 million to 56 million flu illnesses and 24,000 to 62,000 flu deaths in the U.S., although that number is an estimate based on hospitalizations with flu symptoms, not based on actually counting up every person who has died of flu.)

- Postelection audits: In 2018, a review of returned absentee ballot records helped identify anomalies in the election results of Bladen County, North Carolina, enabling election officials to uncover election interference by a political operative who stole and tampered with mail ballots.		

What anti-fraud protections are built into the mail-in ballot process to prevent voter impersonation or ballot theft?		
According to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, there is no evidence that mail balloting increases electoral fraud as there are several anti-fraud protections built into the process designed to make it difficult to impersonate voters or steal ballots.		

Does the rarity of voter fraud in the US, as indicated by multiple studies and statistics, suggest that mail-in ballots being sent to a man's deceased parents in Mercer County in New Jersey are likely to be a significant cause of potential voter fraud in the 2020 U.S Presidential Election?		
Voter fraud in the U.S. is historically rare, according to multiple studies and statistics. Nearly 1 in 4 voters cast ballots in the 2016 presidential election via mail.		

Are instances of voter fraud in the US typically isolated to specific regions or areas?

What does the difficulty in measuring and interpreting the case fatality rate of COVID-19 imply about the likelihood of dying from the disease?		
In order to understand what the case fatality rate can and cannot tell us about a disease outbreak such as COVID-19, it’s important to understand why it is difficult to measure and interpret the numbers.		

Does the claim that there is more chance of an asteroid hitting Earth on 02/11/2020 than dying from COVID-19 imply that COVID-19 is less deadly than the Spanish flu?		
One estimate for the death toll of the Spanish flu, by Johnson and Mueller (2002), is that the pandemic killed 50 million people.2 That would have been 2.7% of the world population at the time.		

How is the chance of dying from COVID-19 calculated?		
It’s calculated by dividing the number of deaths from the disease by the total population. For instance, if there were 10 deaths in a population of 1,000, the crude mortality rate would be [10 / 1,000], or 1%.		

How does the uncertainty of COVID-19 cases affect the comparison of the risk of dying from COVID-19 versus the risk of an asteroid hitting Earth?

262,Nigeria performed poorly in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the past five years.,"Is Nigeria on track to meet the SDG target for U5MR by 2030?		
Our model suggests that Nigeria is not on track to meet the SDG target for U5MR (SDG 3.2.2) by 2030. At current national AARDs, it will achieve SDG 3.2.2 in 2052 (22 years behind schedule).		

What was the state of progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) before the COVID-19 pandemic?		
The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020 brings together the latest data to show us that, before the COVID-19 pandemic, progress remained uneven and we were not on track to meet the Goals by 2030.		

How is Nigeria's progress towards the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) being tracked?		
Given that Nigeria failed to meet its MDG target on U5MR, early tracking of its progress towards the health-related SDG targets is important—if the country is off track, this would highlight the need for intensified action to accelerate progress.		

Does Nigeria's current rate of progress towards achieving the SDG target for neonatal mortality rate (NMR) of 12 deaths per 1,000 live births suggest that it will meet its goal of a 9% annual decrease in NMR between 2018 and 2030?		
For Nigeria to achieve its SDG target for NMR of 12 deaths per 1,00 live births (SDG 3.2.1), its national NMR will have to decrease by 9% every year, on average, between 2018 and 2030.		

What is the status of Nigeria's progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the past five years?		
At historical AARDs, Nigeria, as a country, will achieve its SDG target for NMR in 2060, 30 years behind the SDG target year of 2030.		

Which countries ranked highest in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Index in the given year?		
and Ghana are the best performers, ranking 5th and 9th in the Index. SDG 3 (health) and SDG 9 (infrastructure)		

What is the required average annual decrease in Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR) for some Nigerian states to meet the SDG 3.2.1 target?		
However, the AARD required to reach SDG 3.2.1 at the state level varies widely. While Kwara state has already achieved the SDG 3.2.1 target, some other states such as Zamfara and Kano will need to achieve an average annual decrease in NMR of 11%, and 13% respectively, in order to meet the NMR SDG targets.		

What areas of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has Nigeria made progress in over the past five years?		
Five years since the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals, the 2020 Report notes that progress had been made in some areas, such as improving maternal and child health, expanding access to electricity and increasing women’s representation in government.		

How is Nigeria's performance in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) being tracked and evaluated?		
As Nigeria moves towards achieving its child survival targets, it will be critical for policymakers at the state-level to track their performance on both SDG targets for NMR (SDG 3.2.1) and U5MR (SDG 3.2.2), measure their performance against the policies they introduce, and continuously assess what is possible by comparing their performance with high performing states.		

What would be the outcome if Nigeria achieves its SDG targets for NMR and U5MR?		
In the event that each state in Nigeria achieves and maintains the AARD required for it to meet its SDG targets for NMR and U5MR, we estimate that compared to the baseline scenario, at least 1.89 million neonatal deaths and 5.96 million under-five deaths will be averted between 2018 and 2030 ( Table 7).

What is the relationship between the claim of potential widespread voter fraud via mail-in ballots and the evidence that incidents of mail-in ballot fraud are rare, even in states with universal vote-by-mail systems?

280,False positives and rapid tests put the rate of infection near zero and that there will be no second wave of infections,"Under what conditions are false positives more likely to occur in influenza tests?		
- False-positive results are more likely to occur when influenza prevalence in the population tested (e.g. community) is low, which is generally at the beginning and end of the influenza season and during the summer.		

Does the sensitivity of rapid tests affect the accuracy of the rate of infection reported by these tests?		
However, negative RIDT results do not exclude influenza virus infection as a cause of a respiratory outbreak because of the limited sensitivity of these tests.		

Do false positive results from COVID-19 tests contribute to the rate of infection being near zero?		
Incorrect diagnosis of COVID-19 when it is not present (a false positive result) may lead to unnecessary further testing, treatment, and isolation of the person and close contacts.		

Do rapid tests accurately detect all cases of influenza infection?		
However, due to the limited sensitivities, negative results of RIDTs do not exclude influenza virus infection in patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of influenza.		

Under what conditions might a rapid test result in a false positive, potentially leading to an underestimation of the actual rate of infection?		
- A patient tests positive by RIDT and the community prevalence of influenza is low, and a false positive result is a consideration.		

How does the accuracy of COVID-19 antibody tests vary between patients with mild or moderate symptoms and those with severe symptoms?		
The accuracy of antibody tests for detecting COVID-19 in these patients may be different from the accuracy of the tests in people with mild or moderate symptoms.		

Does the timing of antibody test use affect the accuracy of COVID-19 infection rates?		
The review shows that antibody tests could have a useful role in detecting if someone has had COVID-19, but the timing of test use is important.		

Do false positives from rapid tests contribute to the rate of infection being near zero?		
Some antibody tests could be a useful diagnostic tool for those in whom molecular- or antigen-based tests have failed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including in those with ongoing symptoms of acute infection (from week three onwards) or those presenting with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19.		

How does the presence of clinical signs and symptoms affect the reliability of a positive RIDT result?		
- Having clinical signs and symptoms consistent with influenza increases the pre-test probability of influenza virus infection, which increases the reliability of a positive RIDT result.		

Does the accuracy of antibody tests suggest that the rate of current SARS-CoV-2 infection is near zero?		
To assess the accuracy of antibody tests, firstly, to determine if a person presenting in the community, or in primary or secondary care has current SARS-CoV-2 infection according to time after onset of infection and, secondly, to determine if a person has previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2.

284,Former US vice-president Joe Biden is showing pretty severe signs of dementia.,"How does Joe Biden's lifelong struggle with stuttering relate to the claim that he is showing pretty severe signs of dementia?		
Former Vice President Joe Biden opened up about his lifelong struggle with stuttering on Wednesday, offering a rare lengthy and personal reflection on how it has affected him, even to this day.		

How is dementia diagnosed?		
There is no one test to determine if someone has dementia. Doctors diagnose Alzheimer's and other types of dementia based on a careful medical history, a physical examination, laboratory tests, and the characteristic changes in thinking, day-to-day function and behavior associated with each type.		

Is Joe Biden's forgetfulness a symptom of dementia?		
The headlines after the event? “Biden Forgets Obama’s Name.” Other times when Biden fudges a detail or loses his train of thought, it seems unrelated to stuttering, like he’s just making a mistake.		

How is dementia typically diagnosed?		
To diagnose dementia, a doctor asks about symptoms, performs a physical exam, obtains thorough medical and family histories, and talks with family members to get a complete picture of how symptoms are affecting daily life.		

Does the claim that Joe Biden is showing signs of dementia relate to his stutter?		
Alpern told me that she’s on a group text with other stutterers who regularly discuss Biden, and that it’s been “frustrating” to watch the media portray Biden’s speech impediment as a sign of mental decline or dishonesty.		

How is dementia diagnosed?		
There is no one test to diagnose dementia. Instead, the diagnosis involves a range of assessments and examinations, which can mean that confirming a diagnosis can take time, particularly in the early stages.		

What are the criteria for diagnosing dementia?		
Diagnosing dementia requires a history evaluating for cognitive decline and impairment in daily activities, with corroboration from a close friend or family member, in addition to a thorough mental status examination by a clinician to delineate impairments in memory, language, attention, visuospatial cognition such as spatial orientation, executive function, and mood.		

What are the signs of dementia that can be observed in individuals, even if they appear to function normally on a brief cognitive test?		
For example, in highly educated and highly functioning individuals, a compelling history of cognitive decline (eg, no longer able to perform a complex task that could easily be done a year ago, such as filling out a tax return or working at a cognitively demanding job such as physician or lawyer) can suggest dementia despite “normal” function on a brief, screening cognitive test.		

What does the author of the article suggest was the motivation behind Joe Biden's campaign agreeing to an interview with someone who stutters?		
Listening back to that part of the conversation after our interview made me feel dizzy.

297,Flu shot is 2.4x more deadly than Covid-19.,"Does the flu vaccine reduce the risk of in-hospital deaths, ICU admission, length of ICU stay, and hospital length of stay in patients 65 years or older?		
In an analysis of the 2013-2014 influenza season (the most recent for which data are available), vaccination reduced the odds of in-hospital deaths (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.39; 95% CI, 0.17-0.66), ICU admission (aOR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.48-0.81), length of ICU stay (adjusted relative hazard [aRH], 1.34; 95% CI, 1.06-1.73), and hospital length of stay (aRH, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.13-1.37) in patients 65 years or older.19 Becoming infected with influenza does not prevent a person from becoming infected the next year, or even in the same season; again, this is due to genetic drift or infection with an unrelated influenza virus.		

What is the estimated annual death toll from the flu in the United States?		
These ranges can be quite large, depending on the flu season. Since 2010, there have been 9.2 million to 35.6 million cases of influenza in the United States, causing an estimated 140,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations and 12,000 to 56,000 deaths in each.1 The total economic burden of annual influenza epidemics using projected statistical life-values is nearly $100		

How do the CDC's estimates of the impact of influenza on the US population relate to the claim that the flu shot is 2.4x more deadly than Covid-19?		
Each year, the CDC estimates the impact of influenza on the US population, based on models that incorporate reported death rates (influenza and influenza-related), vaccination rates, and vaccine effectiveness, to arrive at ranges of persons affected, persons hospitalized, deaths, and illness averted.		

What is the effectiveness of the flu vaccine over the past decade?		
Over the past decade, the overall vaccine effectiveness has hovered in the 40% to 55% range, although some years have been better or worse than others (Figure 4).1 For instance, the 2014-2015 season was particularly bad, with vaccine effectiveness of less than 20%.		

What is the effectiveness of the flu vaccine in preventing hospitalizations?		
Recent studies have produced varied results regarding vaccine effectiveness. Baxter et al found that over 11 influenza seasons, vaccination prevented 8.5% of hospitalizations for pneumonia and influenza in those 65 years and older, and 12.4% in those 50 to 64 years.12 Talbot et al reported that influenza vaccination prevented 61% of respiratory hospitalizations in community-dwelling older adults 50 years and older.13		

What does the evidence suggest about the effectiveness of flu vaccines in adults aged 65 years and older?		
Adults aged 65 years and older are at greater risk for hospitalization and death from seasonal influenza and respond to vaccination with lower antibody titers to influenza hemagglutinin compared with younger adults.10 A 2010 Cochrane Review concluded that available evidence provides no guidance regarding the safety or effectiveness of influenza vaccines for people aged 65 years and older.11		

What does the evidence suggest about the effectiveness of the flu vaccine, rather than its deadliness in comparison to Covid-19?		
Results of a single study involving 8963 adults (mean age, 62.5 years) during the 2014-2015 influenza season showed that the recombinant vaccine (RIV4) was more efficacious than the quadrivalent, inactivated virus vaccine (IIV4), and that people receiving it were 30% less likely to become ill with laboratory-confirmed influenza.42,43		

Does the claim that the flu shot is 2.4x more deadly than Covid-19 have any basis in the evidence provided about the effectiveness of the flu vaccine in adults 50 years or older?		
To date, data from adequately powered trials have shown vaccine effectiveness of 40% to 60% in adults 50 years or older when circulating and influenza vaccine strains are similar.26 However, adequately powered trial data are lacking for the cohort of adults 65 years or older.		

Does the effectiveness of the flu vaccine decrease over time?		
A recent examination of vaccine effectiveness among enrollees (all ages) in the US Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network for the 2011-2012 through 2014-2015 influenza seasons supports the notion that effectiveness wanes with time.20		

Does the evidence provided support the claim that the flu shot is 2.4x more deadly than Covid-19?		
The results of three meta-analyses have shown that both trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) reduce laboratory confirmed influenza illness as well as clinical influenza-like illness among children.7 Although effectiveness of the influenza vaccine is well documented, the perception of vaccine safety is the most significant obstacle to overcome in convincing parents to annually vaccinate their young children.

The Lost Cosmonaut rumors have been persuasively debunked as far back as the mid-1960s. It is now known that the Soviets did cover up disasters and accidents within the space program, but there is no evidence to suggest they ever covered up any deaths in orbit.		

Is the photo showing the remains of Vladimir Komarov, a man who fell from space in 1967, authentic?

Were all of Vladimir Komarov's remains found after his fall from space in 1967?		
In a grisly aside to his death, not all of Komarov’s remains were found during the initial search. A group of Young Pioneers—the equivalent of Boy Scouts in the USSR—discovered additional remains that were later buried at the crash site itself.		

Is there any evidence to support the claim that Vladimir Komarov cursed the engineers and flight staff as he descended from space in 1967?		
Eight years after Komarov's death, a story began circulating that Komarov cursed the engineers and flight staff, and spoke to his wife as he descended,[14] and these transmissions were received by an NSA listening station near Istanbul.[15]		

Is the photo of Vladimir Komarov's remains genuine?		
I have to agree as to the validity of the photo of Komarov’s remains : I highly doubt it is genuine. The forces released on impact and the subsequent fire would’ve definitely obliterated any remains.		

What event or incident led to the renewed interest in Vladimir Komarov's story in 2022?

340,"A 6 year old boy begged God to save his mother's life after she was ambushed. Today the NFL honored the organization that yelled ""hope they die"" outside the mothers hospital.","Did the NFL honor the organization that yelled ""hope they die"" outside the mother's hospital?		
Any social media post that claimed ""the NFL will honor and praise the organization that stood out outside [the] hospital chanting"" was at best a misleading attempting to connect dots that didn't exist.		

What did the NFL do in relation to the protests outside the hospital where the boy's mother was being treated?		
Based on our analysis of videos of the shooting and protests, as well as first-person accounts and news reports, these assertions were a blend of fact and distortions of reality — presented in memes such as the one displayed below that aimed to dissuade people against supporting the NFL because of its alleged support for protesters who gathered outside the hospital:		

Is there any evidence that the organization that yelled ""hope they die"" outside the mother's hospital is affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement?		
No evidence connected the shooting — or the suspected gunman — to the BLM movement. Also, the founder of an L.A.-based Black rights group took credit for the hospital protest in a Facebook post that explicitly said the group ""is not BLM.""		

Was the protest outside the hospital where the mother was being treated for gunshot wounds organized by the group that the NFL honored?		
In sum, a group that is not BLM organized the small protest outside the hospital where two deputies received treatment for gunshot wounds, and tried to provoke law enforcement officers standing guard there.		

Is there any evidence that the shooting of the mother was connected to the organization that was honored by the NFL?		
That is all to say, no evidence connected the shooting — or the suspected gunman — to any organization or cause, including the BLM movement like some viral posts claimed.		

Was the NFL's recognition of systemic racism initiative linked to a gathering outside a California medical facility?		
At worst, it was a purposeful attempt to discredit an initiative by the NFL to recognize systemic racism by erroneously linking it to the gathering outside the California medical facility.		

Did BLM protesters allegedly block emergency access to the hospital where the deputies were receiving medical treatment?		
Additionally, hours after the Compton shooting, another layer to the controversy emerged: Reports on social media alleged BLM protesters taunted law enforcement officers standing guard outside the hospital where the deputies were receiving medical treatment, and blocked emergency access to the facility:		

Did the narrator in the footage express support for the mother's death?		
Many who shared the footage assumed the narrator was an ""activist"" and took him to be wrongfully celebrating the shooting.		

Is there any evidence that the narrator of the claim is associated with the BLM movement?		
We also have no evidence to confirm or disprove the claim that the narrator is an ""activist"" or in any way associated with the BLM movement.		

What was the reaction of the NFL to the incident involving the 6-year-old boy and his mother?		
James, who has been vocal about police shootings involving Black people, had not publicly responded to the sheriff's challenge as of early Tuesday morning.

341,Muslim regiment of the Indian Army had refused to fight in India’s 1965 war with Pakistan.,"Did the Indian Army have a Muslim Regiment that existed until 1965?		
The essence of the Pakistani disinformation is that a Muslim Regiment existed in the Indian Army till 1965, but was disbanded because in that conflict 20,000 Muslims refused to fight Pakistan.		

What is the evidence suggesting about the performance of Muslim soldiers in the Indian Army during the 1965 war with Pakistan?		
Such were the legends of Muslim warriors in 1965. The same followed in 1971. In later years Muslim bravehearts of the Indian army proved their mettle in Kargil and in fighting terror groups in J&K. Three army commanders, three corps commanders and a number of two star generals make up the community’s share of achievements in higher ranks.		

What is the percentage of Muslim servicemen in the Indian Army as per the article?		
Thereafter not a single Muslim participated in the 1971 conflict (another lie). Secondly, the percentage of Muslim servicemen as per the article is drastically below the ratio of Muslim population in India.		

What regiment did the person in the evidence belong to during the 1947 Indo-Pakistani War?		
After Independence and the ensuing Partition of India, he opted to join the Indian Army and was a commissioned officer in the Punjab Regiment during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.[7]		

What percentage of Muslim officers and soldiers remained in the Indian Army after the majority migrated to Pakistan post-Independence?		
Such projections obfuscate reality on the ground. Post-Independence, majority of Muslim officers and soldiers migrated to Pakistan, leaving a minuscule minority as the core or seed element of Indian Muslim servicemen distributed in different regiments and units.		

What is the alleged issue concerning the Indian Muslim presence in the Indian armed forces that is mentioned in the evidence?		
It’s an issue very few in India know much about: Indian Muslim presence in India’s armed forces and issues concerning alleged disloyalty to the nation, on which across the board gullibility is very high.		

What was the outcome of the 1965 Indo-Pakistani War?		
In 1966, after a victory for India in the 1965 Indo-Pakistani War, due in good part to the support of Sikhs, however, the Indian Punjab region was divided into three states—Punjab, Haryana, and Himachel Pradesh—and a Punjabi-majority state was created.		

Did the Muslim regiment of the Indian Army refuse to fight in India's 1965 war with Pakistan?		
This is correct. Don’t think it has much to do with where an officer is from. During the 1965 Indo Pak war, Sagat Singh who was a Rajput from Rajasthan did not withdraw from Nathu La in Sikkim even when the High Command wanted to acquiesce to China’s bullying.		

How many Indian Army troops were involved in the 1965 war with Pakistan?		
Over 10,000 troops from the Indian Army took part in the campaign to re-establish British control of the border areas and 1,300 men were killed in action or died from their wounds and sickness.		

Is the composition of regiments in the Indian Army related to the claim that Muslim regiment of the Indian Army had refused to fight in India’s 1965 war with Pakistan?		
No, all the regiments in the Indian Army are not based on caste. For instance, Rajputana Rifles have an equal number of Rajputs and Jats.

Did McDonald's corporate management take any action regarding the claim that their stores were removing American flags in support of Black Lives Matter and antifa?		
McDonald's corporate legal department was fully aware of these hoaxes and had documented them. The evidence supports the reasonable conclusion that McDonald's corporate management made a conscious decision not to train or warn store managers or employees about the calls.		

Has McDonald's taken down American flags at their fast-food restaurants in support of Black Lives Matter and antifa?		
There is no evidence to support this. McDonald’s says that is not the case. And McDonald’s discontinued a related practice, barring workers from moving from one store inside the company to another, in 2017.

Did McDonald's take any actions in support of Black Lives Matter and antifa at their fast-food restaurants?

What happened to one of the new Rafale fighter jets owned by India during a training session?

By wearing Make America Great Again (MAGA) hats, U.S. flags, and even a “convincing” police uniform, the post claimed, ""comrades"" could deceive police and news media into thinking Trump supporters, not antifa, were rioting on Nov. 4, 2020, a day after the U.S. presidential election.		

Is the antifa movement being blamed for the looting and property damage seen during some of the nationwide protests?		
Since nationwide protests began, President Donald Trump and U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr have without evidence blamed the antifa movement — a loose network of groups made up of radicals who rely on direct action, and sometimes violence, to fight the far right and fascism — for the looting and property damage seen during some of the otherwise peaceful rallies.		

Does the federal government have evidence that antifa is involved in inciting violence during protests?		
Attorney General William Barr said Thursday that the the federal government has evidence that the radical left-wing antifa movement as well as other extremist groups have ""hijacked"" legitimate protests around the country to incite violence, and said certain ""foreign actors"" are seizing on the unrest to sow discord in the U.S.		

Are there any credible sources that support the claim that Antifa is recruiting people to dress as President Trump supporters and police to riot on Election Day 2020 in the United States?

Have there been any instances of violent, antifa-led insurrections occurring in the U.S. on Election Day in the past few years?		
We found no evidence of violent, antifa-led insurrections occurring in the U.S. on Nov. 4 over the past few years.		

Have Antifa groups been involved in violent confrontations with far-right groups at protests and rallies in the past?		
Antifa groups have been increasingly active in protests and rallies over the past few years, especially ones that include far-right participants.41 In June 2016, for example, Antifa and other protestors confronted a neo-Nazi rally in Sacramento, CA, where at least five people were stabbed.		

Does the Department of Justice have direct evidence of widespread involvement of antifa followers in the violence seen across the country on Election Day 2020?

Did Joe Biden's administration's response to the swine flu in 2009 match his current administration's response to the coronavirus?

Did Joe Biden's handling of the swine flu in 2009 meet his own standards of effectiveness?		
The record seemingly complicates Biden's claims, in advertising and speeches, that he would have handled state-level coronavirus testing more effectively than the current White House.		

How did Joe Biden's management of the swine flu in 2009 compare to Trump's response to the same situation?		
Obama’s administration reacted with alarm as cases of H1N1 were initially reported. Trump, by comparison, repeatedly reassured the public that everything was under control.

However, during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, the Obama administration suddenly told states to shut down their testing, without providing much in the way of explanation.		

What did the US do regarding H1N1 testing in 2009, according to Dr. Tom Frieden?

363,Antifa Admit to Igniting Fires All Over The Country To Draw Attention To Climate Change,"Are Antifa groups being misrepresented as violent extremists or terrorist organizations in disinformation campaigns?		
Groups like the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) have documented organized disinformation campaigns aimed at spreading a “deliberate mischaracterization of groups or movements [involved in the protests], such as portraying activists who support Black Lives Matter as violent extremists or claiming that antifa is a terrorist organization coordinated or manipulated by nebulous external forces” (ADL, 2020).		

Does the US government view Antifa as a ""terrorist"" organization?		
The escalating use of force against demonstrators comes amid a wider push to militarize the government’s response to domestic unrest, and particularly demonstrations perceived to be linked to left-wing groups like Antifa, which the administration views as a “terrorist” organization (New York Times, 31 May 2020).

Although these incidents account for a small subset of demonstrations, the trend has become another battlefield for the hyper-partisan “culture wars” over America’s history of racism (Bloomberg, 7 June 2020), and a lightning rod for polarized debate over an appropriate response to the ongoing protest movement.

It was one of the first reports of destructive activity that day, and it “created an atmosphere of hostility and tension” that helped spark an outbreak of looting following initially peaceful protests, according to police investigators, who believe the man “wanted to sow discord and racial unrest” (New York Times, 28 July 2020).		

How many incidents of reported fires have been reported in the country since 24 May?		
At least 50 such incidents have been reported around the country since 24 May.

389,The cardinal and unforgivable sin of a French magazine Charlie Hebdo in insulting the holy face of the Prophet once again revealed the hatred and hostility of the political and cultural institutions of the Western world against Islam and the Muslim community.,"What was the nature of the attack on the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo?		
Wednesday's deadly attack in Paris on the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo is the latest in a series of assaults aimed at Western publications that have provocatively depicted the Prophet Muhammad in inflammatory cartoons.		

What was the motivation behind the attack on the office of Charlie Hebdo?		
The motivation behind the attack that has left at least 12 people dead at the office of French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday appears to be its long history of mocking religions, in particular Islam.		

What was the purpose of Charlie Hebdo's work, according to the evidence?		
In Charlie Hebdo's case, it was about satire on the face of it – but more than that, their work was about the very urgent need to preserve free expression, and to condemn – in any and all ways possible – those who seek to destroy it.		

Has the killing of Charlie Hebdo staff been the first instance of Islamists targeting journalists or satirists in the West?		
The killing of the Charlie Hebdo staff was not the first time Islamists have made a point of murdering journalists or commentators, or the first time they have risen up against satirists in the West.		

Did Western commentators and Western Muslims condemn the cartoonists in Denmark and Charlie Hebdo for their actions?		
Shockingly, even Western commentators (and especially Western Muslims) condemned the cartoonists in Denmark, just as they condemned Theo van Gogh and, today, Charlie Hebdo for ""inviting"" these attacks through their ""recklessness.""		

How did the reaction of France's then President Jacques Chirac to the Charlie Hebdo issue reflect his views on the balance between freedom of expression and respect for religious convictions?		
The issue saw unusually high sales, but drew criticism from many Muslim groups. France’s then President Jacques Chirac released a statement at the time saying, “Anything that can hurt the convictions of someone else, in particular religious convictions, should be avoided.		

How did the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine relate to the claim that the magazine insulted the holy face of the Prophet?		
With the massacre of Charlie Hebdo magazine's editors and cartoonists in Paris by Islamic gunmen early Wednesday afternoon, the forces of radical Islam lay the gauntlet down: radical Islam is not just fighting against Western freedom, or the hegemony of Western powers.		

How did Charlie Hebdo respond to criticism of publishing the Prophet Muhammad cartoons?		
Perhaps in this, Charlie Hebdo was way ahead of the rest of us: they, along with the editors of the Danish Jyllands Posten, which first published the ""Mohammed cartoons,"" have been fighting back from the very start.		

What is the author's opinion on the Charlie Hebdo cartoons?		
Viewed in a vacuum, the Charlie Hebdo cartoons (or the Danish ones that preceded it) are hardly worthy of a stirring defense.		

What stance did Charlie Hebdo take in response to criticism of their publication?		
Charlie Hebdo responded by publishing a letter, signed by 12 writers and intellectuals including Salman Rushdie and Ayaan Hirsi Ali, which read, in part, “We, writers, journalists, intellectuals, call for resistance to religious totalitarianism and for the promotion of freedom, equal opportunity and secular values for all.”

390,"The NFL, NBA and MLB have Tax-Exempt status.","Are the NFL, NBA, and MLB exempt from paying taxes due to their classification under Section 501(c)(6) of the IRS code?		
Some critics have maintained that the NFL (and the NFL alone, not other sports leagues) was tax-exempt due to a special ""loophole"" inserted into the tax code in 1966, referencing Section 501(c)(6) of the IRS code, a section that specifically includes ""Professional football leagues"" along with ""business leagues, chambers of commerce, real-estate boards, or boards of trade"" as tax-exempt organizations.		

Does the NFL currently have tax-exempt status?		
The NBA does not have tax-exempt status, and Major League Baseball gave its up in 2007. The NHL still is tax-exempt.		

What type of tax-exempt status do the NFL, NBA, and MLB have, as opposed to charitable organizations?		
According to league spokesman Brian McCarthy, the NFL is organized as a trade or industry association that is exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code, not Section 501(c)(3), which exempts charitable organizations.		

What type of tax-exempt status did the NFL have prior to the 1966 IRS decision?		
Prior to this decision, the NFL was considered a trade association under Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code, which exempted the league from paying federal income tax.[2] In 1966, after successful lobbying by the league, the Internal Revenue Service rewrote Section 501(c)(6) of the Code specifically to include “professional football leagues” as associations exempt from paying federal income taxes.[3]		

What type of organization is the NFL registered as, which allows it to be exempt from paying taxes?		
The reason the NFL doesn’t pay taxes is beyond outdated at this point. The league is a registered 501(c)(6), which “provides for exemption of business leagues, chambers of commerce, real estate boards, boards of trade, and professional football leagues.”		

What is the tax status of the NFL League Office?		
While the NFL League Office was exempt from paying federal income taxes under Section 501(c)(6), each of the individual NFL teams have paid and will continue to pay taxes annually on the individual team’s share of the league’s overall earnings.[5]		

Does the NBA currently have tax-exempt status?		
Major League Baseball decided to forgo its tax-exempt status in 2007. The NHL, PGA and LPGA still have this distinction, while the NBA league office has never been classified as tax-exempt.		

What type of tax-exempt status do the NFL, NBA, and MLB have?		
The NFL has been exempt from federal income taxes as an organization described in §501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue		

Did the NFL, NBA, and MLB have tax-exempt status before the enactment of section 501(c)(6)?		
This is incorrect. While section 501(c)(6) does mention professional football leagues as exempt organizations, the NFL League Office and other professional sports leagues were exempt from taxes long before this provision was enacted.		

What type of classification under the tax code do the NFL, NBA, and MLB use to be considered tax-exempt?		
Since 1966, the tax code has allowed leagues to classify as 501(c)(6) charitable organizations - a classification used by trade and industry organizations - under the assumption that the leagues were promoting the general value of their sports.

The strange reddish sky reported over parts of the UK may appear to some a sign of impending apocalypse or a celestial Instagram filter, but experts say there is a scientific explanation.		

What other factors, besides smoke particles, can cause the sky to appear orange to blood red?		
The brightness of the colors can also be affected by atmospheric conditions. Extra particles in the atmosphere, such as ash from a large wildfire or a recent volcanic eruption, may cause the moon to appear a darker shade of red, according to NASA.		

What is the relationship between the color of the sky and air quality?		
As with red sunsets, the unusual Moon coloration might be pleasing to the eye, but it is a sign of poor air quality.		

Is the sky turning orange to blood red in several parts of the United States due to the same atmospheric conditions that cause a ""blood moon""?		
The name ""blood moon"" is also sometimes used for a Moon that appears reddish because of dust, smoke or haze in the sky.

For this reason, the sunsets have a reddish-orange hue. The effect of a red sunset becomes more pronounced if the atmosphere contains more and more particles.		

What is the effect of the orange-red coloration of the sky in several parts of the United States?		
The result is that the sunlight takes on an orange or red cast, which we can see reflected from clouds or other objects as a colorful sunset (or sunrise).

- Smoke from the fires is filling the atmosphere in many areas along the West Coast, causing skies to turn eerie shades of orange and red.		

What is the reason behind the sky turning orange to blood red in several parts of the United States?		
If the air is polluted with small particles, natural or otherwise, the sunset will be more red. Sunsets over the sea may also be orange, due to salt particles in the air, which are effective Tyndall scatterers.		

What is the common phenomenon that causes the sky to turn orange to blood red in several parts of the United States and also causes the fully eclipsed Moon to take on a red color?		
This is the same mechanism that causes colorful sunrises and sunsets. Red wavelengths are least affected by this effect, so the light reaching the Moon's surface has a reddish hue, causing the fully eclipsed Moon to take on a red color.		

Why does the sky appear orange to blood red in several parts of the United States?		
A red sky suggests an atmosphere loaded with dust and moisture particles. We see the red, because red wavelengths (the longest in the color spectrum) are breaking through the atmosphere.

In halting implementation, Trump is looking out only for his friends in the financial industry, since the rule would have lowered profits and increased litigation and compliance costs for financial service firms.36 Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital who also served as a Trump campaign adviser, was confident that Trump would repeal the rule if elected president, saying, “It could be the dumbest decision to come out of the U.S. government in the last 50 to 60 years.		

Does the president's refusal to release his tax returns prevent the public from understanding his potential conflicts of interest?		
Defying decades of tradition, the president has steadfastly refused to release his tax returns.564 However, what documents the press and general public have seen have revealed a bevy of malfeasance, ranging from ethically dubious to obviously fraudulent.565 Though he has filed required financial disclosure documents listing his own assets, they leave significant gaps in the public’s understanding, not the least of which is that the contents are entirely self-reported and the organization that receives the documents, the Office of Government Ethics, lacks the investigatory capacity to verify the information.566 Requiring the current president to release his tax returns, whether by subpoena or by enacting new legislation, would enable the kind of public scrutiny necessary to understand precisely how compromised a president may be.		

What change in White House policy did the Trump administration make in April 2017?		
On April 14, 2017, the White House announced it would no longer continue the Obama administration policy of publicly releasing White House visitor logs.7 The visitor logs were used by government watchdog groups to monitor lobbyists and corporate executives who visited the White House seeking to exert influence over the president or his administration.

Did Trump request Sessions to step down?		
As is discussed earlier in this report, Sessions announced shortly after he was confirmed to the post that he would recuse himself from matters related to the investigation because of his role on Trump’s campaign, a decision Trump repeatedly criticized.479 On November 7, 2018—the day after Democrats won control of the House of Representatives in the midterm elections—Sessions announced that he was stepping down at Trump’s request.		

What has the Trump administration done over the past 100 days?		
Over the past 100 days, the Trump administration has broken its promises to the American people. It has shown it is interested only in itself and in those to whom it is indebted—namely, large donors and the industries to which administration members owe their careers.		

What actions has the Trump administration taken regarding sanctions on Russia?		
Despite its reported early efforts to do so, the Trump administration has not undone sanctions that the Obama administration placed on Russia.322 However, it has repeatedly undermined attempts to impose new measures to punish Russia’s attacks on the United States and other countries.

Did Richard Jewell's passing a polygraph test lead to a change in the scrutiny he faced from Facebook, which in turn led to Mark Zuckerberg banning his defense from raising money on the platform?		
Yes. Richard Jewell's attorneys paid an ex-F.B.I. agent to administer a polygraph. After Jewell passed the lie detector test, he found himself under less scrutiny.		

Was Richard Jewell's depiction of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in the film being referred to in the letter, the reason for Mark Zuckerberg banning his defense from raising money on Facebook?		
In a December 9 letter to the filmmaker, lawyers for the Journal-Constitution wrote that Richard Jewell’s depiction of Scruggs, who died in 2001 at 42, “makes it appear that the AJC sexually exploited its staff and/or that it facilitated or condoned offering sexual gratification to sources in exchange for stories.”

Xinjiang's population has continued to grow in recent years, and the birth rate of the Uygur population have been higher than Xinjiang's average level.		

Does the steady increase in Xinjiang's total population between 2010 and 2018 indicate that the Uighur population had the region's highest birthrate during that period?

Does the claim that the Uighur population had the region’s highest birthrate, at about 12 newborns per 1,000 people in Xinjiang, China between 2010 and 2018, match the evidence that the birth rate and natural population growth rate of Xinjiang's population were stable while slowing slightly during the same period?		
From 2010 to 2018, the birth rate and natural population growth rate of Xinjiang's population were stable while slowing slightly.		

Does the latest data show that the Uighur population in Kashgar has the region's highest birthrate?		
Uighurs have fewer children than they used to, but since 2010 the birth rate has been rising again. In mainly Uighur Kashgar, a prefecture which borders on Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central Asia, it is four times the national average.

Would eliminating employee payroll taxes as proposed by President Trump result in the depletion of the Social Security trust fund?		
As our analysis based on the Social Security trustees’ projections shows, eliminating employee payroll taxes along the lines that the president has proposed would, absent additional action, completely exhaust the Social Security trust fund by 2026 or earlier and result in steep benefit cuts.		

How would eliminating the employee share of the Social Security tax affect the depletion of the Social Security trust fund?		
- If in 2021, a second-term President Trump permanently eliminates the employee share of the Social Security tax along the lines that he has proposed for his temporary tax delay—limiting it to workers under the wage threshold—the combined trust fund would be exhausted five years later, in 2026, or nine years sooner than the actuaries predicted in April of this year.

On April 3, 2020, the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics issued guidance to physicians, coroners, and medical examiners who fill out death certificates to list COVID-19 as an underlying cause of death in the absence of a test ""if the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty.""		

Does the CDC's report clarify the distinction between deaths that are directly attributed to COVID-19 and those that involve COVID-19 but may not be the underlying cause of death?		
- In this report, we use the term “due to COVID-19” when referring only to deaths with an underlying cause of death as the coronavirus (COVID-19) and the term “involving COVID-19” when referring to deaths that had COVID-19 mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, whether as underlying cause or not.		

Are deaths from poisoning, trauma, and unintentional injury being included in the tally of COVID-19 deaths if they are mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, not just as the underlying cause?

Are the deaths from poisoning, trauma, and unintentional injury that are added to the tally of COVID-19 deaths listed as direct causes of death or as contributing factors in the chain of events that led to the death?		
Of these, 8% involved the coronavirus (COVID-19) (3,912 deaths). The doctor certifying a death can list all causes in the chain of events that led to the death and pre-existing conditions that may have contributed to the death.

Does the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention include comorbid conditions, such as poisoning, trauma, and unintentional injury, on death certificates when calculating provisional death counts for COVID-19?		
Provisional death counts deliver the most complete and accurate picture of lives lost to COVID-19. They are based on death certificates, which are the most reliable source of data and contain information not available anywhere else, including comorbid conditions, race and ethnicity, and place of death.		

Are deaths from poisoning, trauma, and unintentional injury being counted as COVID-19 deaths without a positive COVID-19 test result?		
This means a positive COVID-19 test result is not required for a death to be registered as COVID-19. In some circumstances, depending on national guidelines, medical practitioners can record COVID-19 deaths if they think the signs and symptoms point towards this as the underlying cause.		

Are COVID-19 deaths in the US manually coded on death certificates?

Currently, for consensual yet illegal sexual relations between a teenager age 15 and over and a partner within 10 years of age, “sexual intercourse” (i.e., vaginal intercourse) does not require the offender to go onto the sex offender registry; rather, the judge decides based on the facts of the case whether sex offender registration is warranted or unwarranted.		

Is a 21-year-old who engages in sexual activity with an 11-year-old considered to be a sex offender under state law?		
This is considered statutory rape under state law. Statutory rape laws are based on the assumption that minors are incapable of giving informed consent to sexual activities.		

In which states can a 21-year-old have sex with an 11-year-old without being listed on the sex registry as a sex offender?		
Only 12 states have a single age of consent, below which an individual cannot consent to sexual intercourse under any circumstances, and above which it is legal to engage in sexual intercourse with another person above the age of consent.		

Does the given evidence suggest that the 21-year-old in the claim would be exempt from being listed as a sex offender due to the age of the 11-year-old?		
Generally, statutory rape laws define the age below which an individual is legally incapable of consenting to sexual activity.

What is the minimum age requirement for a person to be considered a victim of statutory rape in California?		
However, if the victim is above this minimum age requirement (13) and below the age of consent (16), it is only illegal to engage in sexual intercourse with that individual if the defendant is at least 18 years of age.		

What is the minimum age below which an individual cannot legally engage in sexual intercourse in the 27 states that do not have a single age of consent?		
Minimum age requirement. In 27 states that do not have a single age of consent, statutes specify the age below which an individual cannot legally engage in sexual intercourse regardless of the age of the defendant (see the second column in Table 1).		

What is the nature of the age of consent in the context of statutory rape laws?		
A common misperception about statutory rape is that state codes define a single age at which an individual can legally consent to sex.		

Is consent a valid defense in a statutory rape case in California?		
However, be aware that, unlike in the case of a rape charge, consent is not a defense to statutory rape in California, as statutory rape is based on the belief that those below the legal age of consent cannot give valid consent to sexual activity.		

Is it possible for a 21-year-old to have sex with an 11-year-old without being listed on the sex registry as a sex offender, according to the provided evidence?		
For example, under the state’s statutory rape laws, if a 16-year-old girl willingly has sex with her 23-year-old boyfriend, her boyfriend can be charged with statutory rape, since the girl, as a minor, is not legally capable of giving consent in the first place.

443,It's NOT a SECOND WAVE of COVID-19 coming soon. It's the NORMAL COLD / FLU SEASON,"How does the fact that humans have no immunity to COVID-19 compare to their immunity to seasonal influenza?		
COVID-19 also appears to cause more severe illness more frequently than seasonal influenza. Part of this difference may be attributed to the fact that COVID-19 is caused by a new type of coronavirus, against which humans have no immunity.		

Is COVID-19 expected to be seasonal like the flu?		
It is possible that COVID-19 could turn out to be a seasonal illness, similar to influenza. However, experts warn that, at least for now, amid the ongoing pandemic, warmer weather is unlikely to drive the disease away.		

How does the contagiousness of COVID-19 compare to seasonal influenza?		
One difference between COVID-19 and influenza is that the former appears to be more contagious than seasonal influenza.		

What is the concern regarding the upcoming 2020 to 2021 flu season in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic?		
As the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues, one major point of uncertainty is the impact this novel pathogen will have during the upcoming 2020 to 2021 flu season.		

What are the similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and the common cold/flu?		
Seasonal coronaviruses should not be confused with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Because flu and the common cold have similar symptoms, it can be difficult to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone.		

How does the superspreading activity of COVID-19 compare to the flu?		
Vulnerable populations and age groups are more susceptible to both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus, but COVID-19 has shown more superspreading activity than the flu (defined as an instance in which an individual has at least 8 transmissions of the disease to other people).		

What is the relationship between the COVID-19 virus and the common cold/flu season?		
A study published in the Journal of Medical Virology showed that coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus was common during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, and patients who experienced coinfection had a higher risk of poor health outcomes.		

What is the relationship between the current COVID-19 pandemic and the typical flu season in the US?		
What we know is that in the current COVID-19 pandemic, the US has its highest mortality from pneumonia and influenza since 2004, although not yet reaching the rates observed during the influenza A H1N1 pandemic in 2009.		

How might COVID-19 and the flu interact during the cold and flu season?		
While the influenza virus is a known contributor to human morbidity and mortality, the question of how a coinfection between COVID-19 and influenza might manifest is of utmost concern.		

Can a person be infected with both COVID-19 and the flu at the same time?		
Infection with one pathogen does not preclude co-infection with a second or more pathogens. Next winter, in the likely absence of an effective COVID-19 vaccine, it is almost certain that influenza strains will circulate in conjunction with COVID-19.

Does the World Health Organization (WHO) agree that wearing masks can help prevent the wearer from infecting others with Covid-19?		
Wearing masks against COVID-19 is beneficial in suppressing pandemic spread, not through preventing the wearer from being infected but by preventing the wearer from infecting others, according to suggestions from the World Health Organization (WHO, 2020a,b,c) and lessons from previous pandemics, such as the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic and the 2009 influenza A virus subtype H1N1 pandemic (Mniszewski et al., 2014; Leung et al., 2020).		

Has the World Health Organization (WHO) changed its stance on the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19?		
The World Health Organization (WHO) has changed its advice on face masks, saying they should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible to help stop the spread of coronavirus.		

Are face masks sufficient on their own to prevent the spread of COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization?		
The WHO's guidance on the use of medical masks makes clear that their use alone is insufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 without proper hand-washing and other measures to protect against human to human transmission.		

Does the World Health Organization recommend the use of masks by community members during the COVID-19 pandemic?		
The deaths of healthcare workers from COVID-19 reflect this risk (Zhan et al., 2020). The use of masks by sick people, despite being the WHO's only recommendation for mask use by community members during COVID-19 pandemic, is supported by the smallest body of evidence.		

Do the World Health Organization and the CDC recommend wearing face masks to help slow the spread of COVID-19?		
Public health experts unanimously agree that masks help slow the spread of Covid-19. The CDC and World Health Organization both released recommendations to the public to wear masks when social distancing is not possible.		

What is the World Health Organization's stance on the effectiveness of personal protective equipment in preventing COVID-19?		
The use of personal protective equipment for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been controversial, with differing guidelines issued by different agencies (Chen et al., 2020).		

Does the World Health Organization recommend the use of face masks for protection against Covid-19?		
The World Health Organization recommends surgical mask for health workers providing routine care to a coronavirus disease patient (World Health Organisation (WHO) 2020), whilst the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended a respirator (Center for Disease Control and Prevention CDC, 2020).		

Does the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend the use of face masks as an added layer of protection against COVID-19?

The claim is misleading; wearing a face mask does not negatively impact the immune system, according to health experts; as of July 2020, international health authorities and governments around the world recommended wearing face masks as part of efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19.		

Does wearing a face mask weaken the immune system?		
The idea that wearing face masks weakens the immune system is not supported by scientific evidence. This article published on The Conversation illustrates how wearing even a cloth face covering can help to limit the spread of COVID-19 by blocking infectious droplets, which is the main mode of disease transmission.		

Does wearing a mask weaken the immune system?		
Mask use does not weaken the ability of the immune system to fight infection. Instead, wearing a mask helps to keep your community safe by preventing the accidental spread of COVID-19 by people who are infected but do not show symptoms.		

Does stress, rather than masks, lower the immune system?		
Finally, while masks do not weaken the immune system, stress might. Now is a stressful time, and unfortunately, stress has been linked with changes in immune system function and increased risk of infections.		

Does wearing a mask weaken the immune system?		
There is no evidence that mask use weakens the immune system. We all have harmless types of bacteria living on the surface of our bodies, and evidence suggests that they might affect the way our immune systems behave, but wearing a mask does not make these bacteria go away.		

Does wearing a face mask protect the immune system from COVID-19?		
International health authorities maintain that wearing a face mask is safe and can in fact protect the immune system from the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19.		

Does wearing a mask weaken the immune system?		
The claim that wearing masks would weaken the immune system is also unsupported by scientific evidence.		

Does prolonged face mask use cause a decrease in immune system function?		
Prolonged wearing of face masks can cause problems such as discomfort, skin irritation, and even pressure ulcers[3], however immunodeficiency is not among the problems caused by prolonged face mask use.		

Do masks have a negative impact on the efficiency of the human immune system?		
Posts that make statements such as: “Masks inhibit oxygen intake and increase CO2 intake, lowering efficiency of the human immune system, and do not stop viruses” or “Hypercapnia can be caused by rebreathing your own exhaled CO2 by wearing a mask continuously” can be found more and more on the Web.		

Does wearing a surgical mask for short periods of time have a significant impact on the immune system?		
It is unfortunate that these posts are not supported by rigorous scientific evidence. Indeed, wearing a surgical mask for short periods of time does not impact significantly physiological respiratory variables[2] and thus, whenever a rise in CO2 occurs in the “dead space” of the mask, it is unlikely that the magnitude of this increase would be sufficient to impair immune, neurological, or cardiovascular homeostasis.

In addition, if the vaccine is available to the applicant but due to limited supply, it would cause significant delay for the applicant to receive the vaccination, then the civil surgeon should also annotate “not routinely available” on Form I-693.[11] USCIS may grant a blanket waiver in these cases.		

What type of vaccination policies are most effective in promoting higher rates of vaccination coverage?		
There is some evidence suggesting vaccination requirements that have broad reach, limited exemption criteria, and strong enforcement may help promote higher rates of vaccination coverage along with complementary actions such as monitoring VPD cases, vaccination coverage, and exemption rates; and also reporting on recent VPD outbreaks.		

What is the role of state and local vaccination requirements in maintaining high vaccination coverage rates in the US?		
State and local vaccination requirements for daycare and school entry are important tools for maintaining high vaccination coverage rates, and in turn, lower rates of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs).		

Does the evidence suggest that the US government has implemented a policy requiring vaccination for children?		
In summary, vaccination requirements that reach more children through a broad range of facilities, that have more requirements for receiving an exemption, that require parental documentation of exemption requests, and that are implemented with strong enforcement and monitoring may help promote higher rates of vaccination coverage, and in turn, lower rates of VPDs.

Some surgical masks may let a significant fraction of airborne viruses penetrate through their filters, providing very low protection against aerosolized infectious agents in the size range of 10 to 80 nm.		

Can a virus pass through a mask?		
Our review of relevant studies indicates that cloth masks will be ineffective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, whether worn as source control or as PPE.		

Can cloth masks effectively prevent the emission of small particles that can spread COVID-19?		
In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19 transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with many potentially infectious people.		

Can a cloth mask effectively prevent the inhalation or emission of small particles, such as viruses?		
In sum, cloth masks exhibit very low filter efficiency. Thus, even masks that fit well against the face will not prevent inhalation of small particles by the wearer or emission of small particles from the wearer.		

Can fabric masks reduce the transmission of respiratory droplets that carry viruses?		
The CDC failed to reference the National Academies of Sciences Rapid Expert Consultation on the Effectiveness of Fabric Masks for the COVID-19 Pandemic (NAS 2020), which concludes, “The evidence from…laboratory filtration studies suggests that such fabric masks may reduce the transmission of larger respiratory droplets.

453,US President Trump instructed his administration to halt funding of the World Health Organization while a review was conducted to assess the World Health Organization’s role regarding the spread of coronavirus.,"Did the US President instruct his administration to halt funding of the World Health Organization permanently, or was it a temporary halt?		
The President had previously announced a temporary halt of funding to the WHO and sent a letter to the agency earlier in May saying that the US would permanently pull funding if the WHO did not “commit to major substantive improvements in the next 30 days.”		

Did Trump instruct his administration to halt funding of the World Health Organization while a review was conducted to assess the World Health Organization’s role regarding the spread of coronavirus?		
In April 2020, Trump announced that he would freeze funding to the World Health Organization over his concerns that it is beholden to China’s interests, and in July, he said he would withdraw the United States from the body completely.		

Did US President Trump instruct his administration to halt funding of the World Health Organization while a review was conducted to assess the World Health Organization's role regarding the spread of coronavirus?		
""I am directing my administration to halt funding while a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization's role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus,"" Mr Trump told a news conference at the White House on Tuesday.		

Did the World Health Organization respond to the letter sent by President Trump to the general director on May 18, warning of a potential permanent freeze on U.S. funding?		
The WHO had no immediate comment. Officials of the U.N. agency have not directly addressed a letter that Trump sent to the general director on May 18, warning he would make permanent a temporary freeze on U.S. funding and reconsider U.S. membership unless it committed to “major substantive improvements within the next 30 days.”		

Why did US President Trump decide to halt funding to the World Health Organization (WHO)?		
US President Donald Trump has said he is going to halt funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) because it has ""failed in its basic duty"" in its response to the coronavirus outbreak.		

What was the reason behind US President Trump's decision to halt funding of the World Health Organization?		
The U.S. is the top contributor to the WHO; the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is second. Trump announced on Tuesday that he would order the U.S. to stop funding the WHO while his administration reviews the organization – which he accused of ""severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.""		

What was the reason behind US President Trump's decision to halt funding of the World Health Organization?		
Trump has been expressing anger at the World Health Organization for weeks over what he has portrayed as an inadequate response to the initial outbreak of the coronavirus in China’s Wuhan province late last year.		

What action did US President Trump take regarding the World Health Organization in relation to the coronavirus pandemic?		
Donald Trump was condemned for putting countless lives at risk on Tuesday when he announced the US is freezing payments to the World Health Organization (WHO) over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.		

How long was the funding of the World Health Organization put on hold by the US President?		
The US president said funding would be on hold for 60 to 90 days pending a review of the WHO’s warnings about the coronavirus and China.		

What were the reasons behind the US decision to halt funding of the World Health Organization?		
Trump’s disgust with the WHO is well-founded, administration officials say. The decision to leave wasn’t solely due to the WHO’s stumbles on COVID-19, but because they capped a record of unresolved structural issues and failures during crises, officials said.

454,Face masks cause hypoxia.,"Does wearing a face mask reduce oxygen levels in the body?		
There is no proof that wearing a mask can reduce oxygen levels, also known as hypoxia. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) recommend wearing cloth masks over a surgical mask in public, which are not too tight on our faces and allow for easy breathing.		

Do face masks cause significant changes in blood oxygen levels (hypoxia) in healthy individuals during physical activity?		
Although the body of literature directly evaluating this issue is evolving, for healthy individuals, the available data suggest that face masks, including N95 respirators, surgical masks, and cloth face masks, may increase dyspnea but have small and often difficult-to-detect effects on Wb, blood gases, and other physiological parameters during physical activity, even with heavy/maximal exercise.		

Does wearing a face mask during moderate-intensity exercise for 60 minutes affect oxygen levels in the blood?		
There are limited data reporting arterial blood gases during exercise while wearing a face mask. Arterial saturation remains above 97% while wearing a surgical mask or N95 respirator while exercising at moderate intensity for 60 minutes (29, 30), indicating that changes in PaO2 sufficient to affect ventilation are unlikely.		

Do studies show that wearing a face mask causes a decrease in oxygen levels in the body?		
The mechanisms of increased dyspnea with face masks are complicated by the fact that several studies fail to show changes in most physiological variables, despite increased dyspnea (15, 45).		

Does wearing a face mask lead to reduced ventilation and rebreathing of exhaled carbon dioxide?		
Purported reasons for not wearing a face mask include concerns about increased dyspnea and work of breathing (Wb) as well as about alterations in pulmonary gas exchange associated with reduced ventilation and rebreathing of exhaled carbon dioxide (4).		

Does wearing a face mask cause hypoxia in individuals with severe cardiopulmonary disease?		
Although the available data suggest that negative effects of using cloth or surgical face masks during physical activity in healthy individuals are negligible and unlikely to impact exercise tolerance significantly, for some individuals with severe cardiopulmonary disease, any added resistance and/or minor changes in blood gases may evoke considerably more dyspnea and, thus, affect exercise capacity.		

Does wearing a surgical mask cause significant oxygen deprivation (hypoxia) during physical activity?		
Furthermore, when these patients performed a 6-minute walk test while wearing a surgical mask, PaCO2 increased by <1 mm Hg, indicating that significant alveolar hypoventilation and CO2 retention is unlikely to be induced by surgical masks during self-paced exercise.		

Do face masks cause hypoxia in individuals during exercise?		
A recent study examined the exercise responses with surgical masks and N95 respirators (31). Capillary PaO2, CO2, and pH at peak exercise did not differ among users of surgical masks, N95 respirators, and standard CPET face masks, suggesting that alveolar ventilation/gas exchange are not significantly impacted by face masks (31).		

Does wearing face masks cause hypoxia in healthy individuals?		
Importantly, healthy individuals have undertaken several weeks of high-intensity exercise training while wearing face masks that are specifically designed to cause a substantial load on the respiratory muscles (23) without reported adverse events, further suggesting that wearing a face mask/respirator during exercise is unlikely to cause harm in healthy individuals.		

Does wearing face masks cause hypoxia, according to the current body of literature evaluating the effects on the cardiopulmonary system?		
Although more high-quality data from well-designed studies are needed, there is a substantial body of literature evaluating various effects on the cardiopulmonary system caused by the following types of face masks: low-resistance face coverings (i.e., cloth and surgical masks); N95 respirators; industrial respirators, such as self-contained breathing apparatuses (SCBAs); and applied external resistors, which generate high resistive loads or added dead space and are used in research studies.

Fox Chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch was rebuffed in his efforts to establish Fox News Canada in 2003 due to Canadian laws regarding foreign ownership of print and broadcast media, but the CRTC approved an application to bring the Fox News Channel to Canadian digital television line-ups back in November 2004, and that channel is now carried by dozens of different digital providers throughout Canada.		

Why did the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) decide that Fox News is not competitive with any Canadian pay or specialty service?		
However, in its decision, the CRTC said Fox News offers little Canadian coverage and is not ""partially or totally competitive with any Canadian pay or specialty service.""		

Is there a law in Canada that prohibits the broadcasting of false information as news?		
Since at least 2011, rumors have circulated claiming the Fox News television channel has been banned in Canada due to their running afoul of Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) prohibitions that make it ""illegal to broadcast lies and label it news"":		

Does the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) regulations apply to non-Canadian broadcasters like Fox News?		
The CRTC regulations apply only to Canadian broadcasters using Canadian airwaves; they do not apply to the Fox News Channel, which is a non-Canadian entity transmitted via satellite and cable, not broadcast over public airwaves.		

Was Fox News Channel approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for broadcast in Canada?		
The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved an application Thursday to bring the Fox News Channel, one of the highest-rated news channels in the United States, onto Canadian digital airwaves.		

Is Fox News available in Canada through cable or satellite providers?		
The Fox television network (known as the Fox Broadcasting Company), which is a broadcast entity distinctly different from the Fox News Channel, does not have any affiliates or owned-and-operated stations in Canada, but Fox network programming is carried on cable and satellite providers in Canada and is available over the airwaves through several U.S. stations located near the U.S.-Canada border.		

In what year did the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission reject Fox News' bid for broadcast in Canada?		
Fox News first bid for broadcast in Canada -- filed by private Canadian operators, along with HBO, ESPN, and other American channels -- was rejected by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, the federal body that regulates the airwaves, in 2003.		

Is Fox News a program supplier to any of Canada's licensed, English-language, specialty news services?		
The Commission also notes that Fox News is not a program supplier to either of Canada's licensed, English-language, specialty news services, and that neither CTV Newsnet nor CBC Newsworld filed comments in this proceeding.		

Is Fox News classified as an ""entertainment"" channel in Canada?		
(The claimed distinction that Fox News Channel is only allowed in Canada due to its being classified as an ""entertainment"" channel rather than as a ""news"" channel is a meaningless one, as those classifications only apply to Canadian media outlets, and Fox is an American company.)		

What concern did the Canadian Broadcast Authority (CAB) have about adding Fox News to the list of eligible satellite services for distribution in Canada?		
|The CAB had suggested that the addition of Fox News would create a precedent that would reward and encourage non-Canadian broadcasters to forgo partnerships with Canadian broadcasters in favour of gaining direct access to the Canadian market through inclusion on digital lists.

462,US cable news channel Fox News is not available in Canada due to media legislation in the country.,"Is Fox News a program supplier to any of Canada's licensed, English-language, specialty news services?		
The Commission also notes that Fox News is not a program supplier to either of Canada's licensed, English-language, specialty news services, and that neither CTV Newsnet nor CBC Newsworld filed comments in this proceeding.		

In what year did the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission reject Fox News' bid for broadcast in Canada?		
Fox News first bid for broadcast in Canada -- filed by private Canadian operators, along with HBO, ESPN, and other American channels -- was rejected by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, the federal body that regulates the airwaves, in 2003.		

What was the Canadian Cable Television Association's (CCTA) concern regarding the distribution of Fox News in Canada?		
|The CCTA strongly disagreed with the CAB's suggestion that authorizing the distribution of Fox News in Canada would create a precedent that encourages non-Canadian broadcasters to forego partnerships with Canadian broadcasters in favour of a direct market entry approach.		

What concern did the Canadian Broadcast Authority (CAB) have about adding Fox News to the list of eligible satellite services for distribution in Canada?		
|The CAB had suggested that the addition of Fox News would create a precedent that would reward and encourage non-Canadian broadcasters to forgo partnerships with Canadian broadcasters in favour of gaining direct access to the Canadian market through inclusion on digital lists.		

Why did the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) object to the addition of Fox News to its lists of eligible satellite services for distribution on a digital basis?		
|The CAB objected to the addition of Fox News. It submitted that the approval of this service would create a precedent that would reward and encourage non-Canadian broadcasters who choose to forgo partnerships with Canadian broadcasters and opt instead for direct market entry by way of inclusion on the digital lists.		

What was the main reason for Fox News not launching in Canada, according to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission?		
Based on the record of the current proceeding, the Commission understands that the decision of Global TV and its partner Fox News not to launch Fox News Canada was due, in part, to difficulties with the insertion of Canadian content, difficulties which, in the Commission's view, other types of Category 2 services having non-Canadian partners would not likely encounter.		

Does Fox News provide significant coverage of Canadian news stories?		
|Further, in the Commission's view, a comparison of the programming of Fox News with that of licensed Canadian news services indicates that, while all of these services offer coverage of major world news stories of the day, Fox News offers little or no Canadian coverage.		

Did Fox News initially face any issues with broadcasting in Canada due to media legislation, and if so, what was the outcome of these issues?		
Fox was denied broadcast in 2003, but not because Canadians found it to be untruthful. And Fox News got its approval to broadcast via satellite in 2004 and certainly has a dish presence up north today.		

What was the view of REAL Women of Canada regarding the addition of Fox News to Canadian television services?		
|REAL Women of Canada supported the addition of Fox News. In its view, the service would not compete with Canadian services, since it frequently provides perspectives that differ from those of Canadians and Canadian services.		

What contribution did Fox News make to the Canadian broadcasting system according to the CCTA?		
The CCTA also stated that Fox News would make a tangible contribution to the Canadian broadcasting system, as it could significantly boost digital penetration in Canada, thereby increasing the availability of licensed Canadian digital services.

Nearly all 216 miles built since Trump took office replaced outdated or dilapidated fencing. Only about “three miles of new border wall system [have been] constructed in locations where no barriers previously existed,” according to Homeland Security’s June 19 status report on the wall.		

How much of the border wall built by Trump's administration is new construction, rather than replacement of existing barriers?		
Trump has repeatedly pledged to construct 450 miles of barriers by the end of 2020 -- but most of the 100 miles completed thus far have been replacements of the smaller barrier designs that were constructed with decades-old technology.		

What type of border wall construction is Donald Trump referring to when he says ""We have already built 300 miles of border wall""?		
Overall, when Trump says they've built 200 miles or more of border wall, what he's referring to is the replacement of older barriers with new fences, not 200 miles of barriers protecting the border for the first time.

495,"This Democratic Party of Joe Biden is pushing the so-called Green New Deal. If given power, they would essentially ban animal agriculture and eliminate gas-powered cars.","What is the relationship between the Democratic Party's environmental policies and the Green New Deal?		
The Democratic debate over environmental issues has centered heavily around the Green New Deal, a plan to rapidly switch to clean energy to head off the worst projected effects of climate change.		

What are the key components of the Democratic Party's plan to reduce carbon emissions?		
To reach net-zero emissions as rapidly as possible, Democrats commit to eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035 through technology-neutral standards for clean energy and energy efficiency.		

Does the Democratic Party of Joe Biden support the Green New Deal in its entirety, including its potential implications for animal agriculture and gas-powered cars?		
- Not all Democratic presidential candidates back the Green New Deal, with some arguing it boxes them in too much on specifics, while many Republicans, including the president, say it’s not affordable and could cost tens of trillions of dollars if fully implemented.		

What is the proposed approach of the Green New Deal, according to its critics?		
Some critics in both parties have argued the Green New Deal places too much emphasis on direct government investment and should instead give the private sector incentives to change on its own.		

Does the Green New Deal resolution, supported by the Democratic Party of Joe Biden, include a carbon tax or other price on emissions?		
The Green New Deal resolution doesn’t rule out a carbon tax or other price on emissions, but some activists supporting it are skeptical of the concept.		

What is the timeline for achieving net-zero emissions under the Green New Deal, as proposed by some of its supporters?		
One complaint is that it creates unreasonable expectations by demanding a rapid shift toward net-zero emissions that some climate and industry experts argue is beyond current limitations, especially given that some activists backing the Green New Deal say the United States should reach net-zero emissions as soon as 2030.		

Does the Green New Deal aim to eliminate gas-powered cars?		
That's what environmental activists want, for the sake of curbing climate change. For instance, the Green New Deal proposed by Democrats calls for phasing out carbon-emitting vehicles within a decade — which would require not only very fast production of electric vehicles but also a sudden withdrawal of combustion vehicles from roads.		

What are the goals and benefits of the Green New Deal, according to its advocates?		
Green New Deal advocates argue that the scale of the problem requires massive coordinated action across the government and private sector and that by tackling the issue as soon as possible, the changes can be implemented in ways that would benefit Americans by creating jobs, providing cleaner air and water, and expanding the safety net.		

Does the Democratic Party of Joe Biden have a comprehensive plan to address every aspect of the Green New Deal resolution?		
Democratic presidential candidates backing the Green New Deal have released their own environmental plans, and there’s no sign of one comprehensive piece of legislation around the corner that addresses every aspect of the resolution.		

Will the Democratic Party of Joe Biden set a firm date for the transition to electric vehicles and renewable energy under the Green New Deal?		
Biden has pledged to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in electric vehicles and renewable energy, but doesn't set a firm date for the transition.

By contrast, Joe Biden supports taxpayer funding of abortion, repealing the Hyde Amendment, ending a Mexico City policy that prevents federal funding from supporting abortions around the world.		

Does Joe Biden support sanctuary cities and cutting off federal dollars to them?		
Others were long overdue, such as recommitting ourselves to the public-charge principle, rescinding unconstitutional executive actions like DACA, banning entry of people from countries that are terrorist havens and whose backgrounds cannot be vetted, and cutting off federal dollars to sanctuary cities that obstruct federal law.		

Does Joe Biden support sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants?		
Sanctuary jurisdictions are cities, counties, and states that refuse to cooperate with federal enforcement of immigration laws and, in some cases, actually attempt to obstruct federal enforcement.		

Does the evidence suggest that Joe Biden supports immigrants relying on public resources for their needs?		
REF As the DHS points out in its new rule, in a related immigration provision, Congress articulated our immigration policy that “aliens within the Nation’s borders not depend on public resources to meet their needs, but rather rely on their own capabilities and the resources of their families, their sponsors, and private organizations.”REF		

Does Joe Biden support sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal immigration laws?		
A sanctuary jurisdiction was defined as any city or county that refused to comply with 8 U.S.C. § 1373, to provide advance notice of the release of criminal aliens, and to give federal immigration agents access to local jails.		

What immigration policy did Joe Biden's predecessor, Barack Obama, implement in 2012?		
In June 2012, President Barack Obama—without legal authority under any immigration statute or the approval of Congress—directed the Department of Homeland Security to establish the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.		

Does the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) support policies that discourage illegal entry and provide resources for asylum seekers?		
This is a necessary and important policy. As the DHS says, the MPP “will discourage individuals from attempting illegal entry and making false claims to stay in the U.S., and allow more resources to be dedicated to individuals who legitimately qualify for asylum.”REF

498,"As we speak the US are developing a growing number of treatments, including convalescent plasma, that are saving lives all across the country.","Is there sufficient evidence to prove that convalescent plasma is effective in treating COVID-19?		
“While the data to date show some positive signals that convalescent plasma can be helpful in treating individuals with COVID-19, especially if given early in the trajectory of disease, we lack the randomized controlled trial data we need to better understand its utility in COVID-19 treatment,” Dr. Thomas File, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in a statement.		

Has the use of convalescent plasma been successful in treating other diseases in the past?		
While the use of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 was only recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for clinical trials and expanded clinical use, it has been successful in the past for treating diseases such as hepatitis B, influenza and Ebola.		

Are the studies on convalescent plasma for COVID-19 definitive in determining its effectiveness in saving lives?		
Studies have shown that convalescent plasma for COVID-19 is generally safe. And while other studies have hinted that the treatment shows promise, they aren't definitive answers about whether it's effective.		

Has the US FDA approved convalescent plasma as a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19?		
""Although promising, convalescent plasma has not yet been shown to be safe and effective as a treatment for COVID-19,"" the agency wrote.		

Are the treatments, including convalescent plasma, being developed in the US effective in saving lives?		
“Although promising, convalescent plasma has not been shown to be effective in every disease studied” and therefore clinical trials were needed to see if it was useful in covid-19, the FDA cautioned.		

Does the available data support the claim that convalescent plasma is saving lives across the country?		
This has led to calls for the wider adoption of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 (23). Nonetheless, while the data support safety and potential efficacy of convalescent plasma, randomized trials are needed (23).		

Are there any studies that have shown that convalescent plasma is effective in treating Covid-19?		
However, like blood, convalescent plasma is in limited supply and must come from donors. And while there are promising signals from some studies, there is not yet randomized clinical trial data on convalescent plasma to treat Covid-19.		

Are the treatments, including convalescent plasma, being developed in the US proven to be saving lives?		
Data from rigorously controlled clinical trials of convalescent plasma are also few, underscoring the need to evaluate its use objectively for a range of indications (e.g., prevention vs. treatment) and patient populations (e.g., age, comorbid disease).		

Does the available data from China suggest that convalescent plasma is effective in treating COVID-19?		
Convalescent plasma has also been used in the COVID-19 pandemic; limited data from China suggest clinical benefit, including radiological resolution, reduction in viral loads, and improved survival.		

Has the FDA issued an emergency authorization for convalescent plasma as a COVID-19 treatment?		
Despite these warnings from public health experts, the FDA issued an EUA for convalescent plasma as a COVID-19 treatment on August 23, touting it as ""another achievement in (the) Administration's fight against the pandemic.""
