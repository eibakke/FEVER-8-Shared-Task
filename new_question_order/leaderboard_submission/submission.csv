Herd immunity against COVID-19 should be achieved by protecting people through vaccination, not by exposing them to the pathogen that causes the disease.		

Are ""pox parties"" where children are intentionally infected with COVID-19 being considered as a potential method to create herd immunity against COVID-19?

Is the World Health Organization in agreement with the idea of deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" to create herd immunity?		
However, according to the World Health Organization, “Attempts to reach herd immunity through exposing people to a virus are scientifically problematic and morally unethical.”		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a recommended method for achieving herd immunity against COVID-19?		
Herd immunity for COVID-19 through natural infection can pose many challenges. COVID-19 can cause serious complications and millions of deaths, therefore the experts recommend trying to achieve herd immunity through vaccination.		

Is deliberately infecting children to COVID-19 at ""pox parties"" a scientifically supported method for creating herd immunity against COVID-19 without a vaccine?

It has now been shown to provide no benefit to the mother and to result in harm to the neonate. The clinical trial evidence relating to delayed cord clamping compared to immediate cord clamping is presented and the physiological rationale for delayed cord clamping is discussed in this paper.		

What are the benefits of delayed umbilical cord clamping?		
Extensive research into the subject of umbilical cord clamping over the last few decades has now shown that rather than clamping the umbilical cord immediately, leaving it to pulsate and transfer the blood from the placenta to the baby, as nature intended, has many proven benefits both long-term and short-term for a new-born.		

What are the findings of recent scientific studies on the benefits of delayed cord clamping for babies?		
However, the most recent scientific studies on cord clamping seem to indicate that delayed cord clamping may be beneficial to both premature and full-term babies.		

What is the recommended time frame for cutting the umbilical cord after delivery?		
The optimal time to cut the umbilical cord will depend on your circumstances. Delaying cord clamping for at least 1-3 minutes after delivery allows more of the baby’s blood to return from the placenta into the baby and is usually advantageous for the baby.		

At what stage is the umbilical cord typically cut during birth?		
Clamping and cutting the umbilical cord after birth is one of the steps in the birth process. Debate about the appropriate time to clamp and cut the umbilical cord has been ongoing for many decades [1].		

Is the practice of cutting the umbilical cord immediately after birth related to the timing of vaccinations and medication for newborns?		
Immediate or early clamping and cutting of the umbilical cord is thus common practice among health-care providers.		

Does cutting the umbilical cord immediately after birth prevent the baby from receiving natural immunity?		
Shortly after a new baby is born the umbilical cord is clamped and then cut. Delayed cord clamping refers to the process of waiting several minutes before clamping the umbilical cord after birth.		

What is the recommended timing for clamping the umbilical cord?		
More and more professional bodies are recommending delayed cord clamping. Clamping of the umbilical cord is a procedure that is often done quickly, almost as a reflex and without much thought.

What is the recommended time frame for delaying umbilical cord clamping after birth?		
There is no agreement, however, on how long the delay should be before clamping the cord. This study aimed to establish when blood ceased to flow in the umbilical cord to determine how long to delay clamping of the umbilical cord following delivery of the term newborn to maximise placental transfusion.		

What is the recommended time frame for cutting the umbilical cord after birth to ensure the baby has enough blood?		
The optimal time to cut the umbilical cord will depend on your circumstances. Delaying cord clamping for at least 1-3 minutes after delivery allows more of the baby’s blood to return from the placenta into the baby and is usually advantageous for the baby.		

What is the recommended time frame for clamping and cutting a baby's umbilical cord after birth, according to the World Health Organisation and the UK's NICE?		
Clamping and cutting a baby’s umbilical cord as soon as it is born can be bad for its health. The World Health Organisation advises that clamping should be delayed for two to three minutes after the baby has been born, and the UK watchdog NICE advices midwives and obstetricians not to clamp the cord earlier than one minute after the birth.		

What is the recommended approach for cutting the umbilical cord after birth?		
New research indicates that rather than setting a particular time when the umbilical cord should be cut (the World Health Organisation suggests at least 3 minutes), it is better to assess the baby and the umbilical cord’s condition, this is known as physiological cord clamping or optimal cord		

What is the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommendation for the timing of umbilical cord clamping after birth?		
Recommendations for when to clamp and cut the cord differ. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) advises waiting 30 to 60 seconds after the birth of a preterm infant, but acknowledges there is insufficient evidence to support delayed cord clamping in full-term infants born in areas that do not lack resources.		

What is the recommended timing for cutting the umbilical cord after birth based on the baby's physiology?		
Instead, the decision for clamping the umbilical cord after birth should probably be based on the infants’ physiology rather than an arbitrary period of time.		

What is the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' recommendation regarding the timing of umbilical cord clamping after birth?		
The ACOG does not endorse the practice of delayed cord clamping but rather suggests cord clamping should take place between 30 to 60 seconds after birth, since the ideal timing for cord clamping has yet to be established.		

Is the decision to delay cord clamping after birth based on the preference of the healthcare provider?		
They refer to the benefits of delaying cord clamping. Therefore, the amount of time between birth and cord clamping is a decision made by the individual health care provider based largely on personal preference.		

Is the immediate clamping and cutting of the umbilical cord after birth necessary for a baby to have enough blood right after birth?		
Shortly after a new baby is born the umbilical cord is clamped and then cut. Delayed cord clamping refers to the process of waiting several minutes before clamping the umbilical cord after birth.

Are lockdowns in the US a contributing factor to the excess deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19 in 2020?		
Some argue that many of these excess deaths are related to COVID-19 lockdowns, not COVID-19 themselves, Faust said, because people fear catching the disease if they go to the hospital for other reasons.		

What does the concept of ""excess deaths"" refer to in the context of COVID-19?

Would the number of excess deaths in the US have been higher if lockdowns were not in place in 2020?		
- While these negative health impacts of lockdown exceed the impacts of COVID-19 directly, they are much smaller than the negative impacts estimated for a scenario in which these measures are not in place; without these mitigations, the impact of direct COVID-19 deaths alone on both mortality and morbidity would be much higher – an estimated 439,000 excess deaths resulting from COVID-19, and 3,000,000 QALYs lost.		

What types of deaths are being suggested to be misclassified or indirectly caused by the pandemic in the claim about US lockdowns?		
Finally, estimates of excess deaths attributed to COVID-19 might underestimate the actual number directly attributable to COVID-19, because deaths from other causes might represent misclassified COVID-19–related deaths or deaths indirectly caused by the pandemic.

131,We do not know where Covid-19 places among causes of death because the data is not published.,"Is there a comprehensive dataset available to determine the ranking of COVID-19 among causes of death?		
data by all causes of death to validate COVID-19 deaths and assess the 		

What is the primary source of data used to track COVID-19 deaths?		
Provisional death counts deliver the most complete and accurate picture of lives lost to COVID-19. They are based on death certificates, which are the most reliable source of data and contain information not available anywhere else, including comorbid conditions, race and ethnicity, and place of death.		

How are the total number of deaths due to COVID-19 being estimated in the study?		
First, we use information from the most recent at the time of writing excess mortality report, based on deaths until 28 August to infer the total number of deaths where COVID-19 was stated as the underlying cause of death:		

How does the availability of COVID-19 death data compare to the availability of excess-mortality data?		
However, the timeliness with which the COVID-19 death data are available from the states and the data’s earlier completeness relative to the excess-mortality data allow us to draw more valid conclusions about the current state of the pandemic than we could with excess-mortality data.		

Does the available data on COVID-19 deaths provide a complete picture of the pandemic's impact on mortality rates?		
In conjunction with indicators related to testing, cases, hospitalizations and other measures, excess mortality from all causes can not only provide more complete information on the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, it should help to inform public health action.		

What are the limitations of the NCHS data in estimating excess deaths in the United States?		
Estimating excess deaths in the United States requires all-causes mortality data from the NCHS.6 However, the NCHS data could be inadequate for making policy decisions related to COVID-19 because they are not fully accurate in time to be helpful.		

What does the Public Health England (PHE) weekly reports on excess mortality indicate about the relationship between COVID-19 and causes of death?		
We set out to determine how many COVID-19 deaths where COVID-19 is the underlying cause and when COVID-19 is not considered as the underlying cause using Public Health England (PHE) weekly reports on excess mortality (published since the week ending 3 July 2020).		

Is the underlying cause of death for COVID-19 reported on death certificates?		
Second, we use similar calculations for every mortality report published to date to obtain the total number and proportion of death certificates that featured COVID-19, not as the underlying cause of death.		

How can COVID-19 mortality be measured due to the challenges in tracking COVID-related deaths?		
Knowing about these data limitations can improve analysis. For example, since there are challenges tracking COVID-related deaths, COVID-related mortality might be better measured by comparing the number of deaths from all causes during the pandemic with the expected number of deaths for the same period.		

Is the data on Covid-19 mortality rates and causes of death available for comparison with 2019 figures?		
This publication provides data on mortality rates and causes of death in 2019, which may be used to compare with provisional data for 2020, including data on deaths during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, as these become available.

There is new evidence, including from a recent comprehensive study from South Korea, suggesting there is an age gradient in terms of transmission risk from children, meaning younger children (<10 years old) are less likely to transmit compared to adults, while older children (10 and older) may transmit at levels similar to adults.

- Issue: A current Republican legislative proposal would permit insurers to offer plans that exclude coverage of treatment for preexisting health conditions, even while the bill would maintain the Affordable Care Act’s rule prohibiting denial of coverage to people with a preexisting condition.		

Does John Cornyn's plan guarantee that people with pre-existing conditions will be able to purchase health insurance?		
Second, the amended version includes a provision backed by Senator Ted Cruz, which would eviscerate protections for people with pre-existing conditions in the individual market and drastically raise premiums for comprehensive plans that cover critical benefits.		

Does John Cornyn's plan guarantee insurance to people with pre-existing conditions?		
Like the ACA, the Senate proposal purports to guarantee insurance to people with pre-existing conditions.		

Does John Cornyn's plan guarantee that insurers must sell plans to any patient with pre-existing conditions?		
Cruz's amendment proposed allowing insurance companies to sell plans that did not meet the ACA's requirements, as long as they also offered plans that did meet the requirements.[2]		

Does John Cornyn's plan offer the same level of protection as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in regards to pre-existing conditions?		
Republicans in Congress have suggested legislation that would protect those with pre-existing conditions, but those bills have not offered the same, groundbreaking level of protection Obamacare provides: that a patient's current health could not be considered by insurance companies doling out plans, so people are not charged more or denied care because of their health.		

How would John Cornyn's plan protect patients with pre-existing conditions?		
This bill would prevent insurers from refusing or varying premiums based on preexisting conditions. But, unlike the ACA, this bill would allow insurers to sell plans that entirely exclude coverage for care pertaining to the preexisting conditions themselves.		

What specific health conditions would be covered under John Cornyn's plan?		
While the Ensuring Coverage for Patients with Pre-Existing Conditions Act maintains the ACA’s provisions that require insurers to enroll individuals with preexisting conditions, the proposed bill would not require that the conditions themselves be covered.		

Does John Cornyn's plan maintain the Affordable Care Act's provisions regarding pre-existing conditions?		
The plan does keep some of the Affordable Care Act's most popular provisions, including barring insurers from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions and allowing people to stay on a parent's health insurance plan until age 26.		

How does John Cornyn's plan ensure that people with pre-existing conditions can afford health insurance?		
Democrats argue that the claims in the Republicans' ads, including Chabot's ads, are misleading. While the AHCA would have prevented insurers from limiting access to those with pre-existing conditions, the increasing costs could have unintentionally forced many off their plans anyway, health care experts warned.		

How does John Cornyn's plan differ from the Affordable Care Act in terms of coverage for pre-existing conditions?		
However, in contrast with the ACA, the proposed legislation would permit insurers to sell plans that entirely exclude coverage for treatment of an enrolled individual’s preexisting condition (Exhibit 1).3 Prior to the ACA’s implementation in 2014, plans sold in the individual market often incorporated such coverage exclusions.4

Does the administration's plan to get rid of the Affordable Care Act align with the claim that President Trump and you have a plan to improve healthcare and protect pre-existing conditions for every American?		
Protections for people with preexisting conditions are already in place under the Affordable Care Act, though the administration — as the order emphasizes — wants to get rid of that law.

Does the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's assessment of COVID-19 contradict the World Health Organization's estimate of its mortality rate?		
Fauci said COVID-19 is at least 10 times ""more lethal"" than the seasonal flu, even if the mortality rate drops far below the World Health Organization's current estimate of 3.4%.		

How does the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention define and report flu-related deaths in the US?

How does President Trump's plan to alter the funding of Social Security increase the risk of the program becoming permanently depleted?		
Trump would be the first president to fiddle with the stability of Social Security funding.

The president also strongly opposed cuts to Social Security during the campaign, but the new budget would make cuts to Social Security Disability Insurance, which covered over 10 million recipients as of December 2015.

What is the relationship between the size of the COVID-19 virus and the ability of an N95 mask to filter it out?

How effective is a surgical mask in protecting the wearer from smaller particles?		
But how well a surgical mask protects you, the wearer, from smaller particles can vary widely when tested with the same methods used to test N95 respirators.

Many in society are likely to equate Pedophilia with child molestation. They are not the same. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)1 may be contributing inadvertently to the misconception that they are the same, for the following three reasons:		

Does the California bill that standardizes the rules about who is required to be on the state's sex offender registry make pedophilia legal in California?		
Contrary to QAnon-fueled claims that a California bill would legalize pedophilia, the bill would actually standardize the rules about who is required to be on the state’s sex offender registry.

under age 14 as sexual abuse under Penal Code section 288 in the absence of any 		

What does the term ""pedophilia"" refer to in this context?

Is having sex with a minor legal in California?		
(Note that the age of consent to have sex in California is 18 years of age).		

Does the proposed bill in California aim to remove the exclusion of pedophilia from the definition of sexual orientation?		
A provision of existing law prohibits the term sexual orientation from including pedophilia. This bill would delete the provision related to pedophilia.		

Did the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5) reclassify pedophilia as a sexual orientation rather than a mental disorder?		
In recent weeks I have read a couple of postings suggesting that the new version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5) has taken Pedophilia out of the realm of (psycho)pathology and made it equivalent to sexual orientation (e.g., gay, straight, bisexual, transgendered, etc.).
