93,"Sweden, which does not require the wearing of masks in public, has had few deaths due to COVID-19","Did Sweden's strategy of not imposing stringent public health mandates, such as mask-wearing, contribute to its COVID-19 death toll?		
Because of Sweden’s unique strategy of not imposing stringent public health mandates, we used an individual-based model parameterized on Swedish demographics to assess the impact of measures deployed against COVID-19.		

What is Sweden's approach to containing the COVID-19 pandemic?		
Sweden’s strategy to contain the COVID-19 pandemic stands out internationally as more liberal in terms of not ordering a complete lockdown of society.		

Did Sweden's decision not to require the wearing of masks in public contribute to its high mortality rate during the COVID-19 pandemic?		
From Heba Habib's article I understand that Sweden's decision not to to mandate lock down has been a failure, because the population has not acquired herd immunity and because of the country's high mortality rate.		

Did Sweden experience a similar economic downturn and high numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths despite not implementing stay-at-home orders or closing businesses?		
The case of Sweden supports this hypothesis. Though Sweden did not close businesses or implement stay-at-home orders, it suffered a similar economic downturn as other Scandinavian countries while experiencing high numbers of cases and deaths resulting from COVID-19.[30]		

Does the widespread use of masks in Taiwan contribute to its lower incidence of COVID-19 compared to Sweden?		
But Javid said that while this is still just correlative evidence, it could be one reason why countries like Taiwan, which doesn't have total lockdown measures in place but does have widespread mask usage, has a much lower incidence of COVID-19 than other countries like Sweden, for example, where masks are less commonly used.		

Does Sweden's lack of mask mandates contribute to its low COVID-19 death rate?		
Sweden’s approach has advertised particular reliance on social distancing and voluntary individual behaviors supplementing public health mandates, so we examined which of these measures is most likely to explain Swedish COVID-19 spread to date, what the future implications are for Sweden, and what lessons the global public health community can glean.		

Does Sweden's lack of mask-wearing requirement in public correlate with its reported number of COVID-19 cases and deaths?		
Other European countries, such as Sweden, which have reported fewer cases of COVID-19 overall, have fewer and much less restrictive measures in place.		

What is the number of COVID-19 deaths in Sweden according to the evidence provided?		
Also, as the number of COVID-19 deaths in Sweden is really remarkably high, effective vaccinations and better treatments may yet save countries that have chosen containment from such figures.		

Does the Swedish government's COVID-19 strategy, often referred to as ""herd immunity,"" appear to be effective in reducing the number of deaths from the virus?		
However I would like to point out that the author relied on the premise that the Swedish government's strategy of managing the COVID-19 pandemic (misleadingly labelled as 'herd immunity' not just by inference in this article but also by many other governments and commentators who supported the alternative ""containment"" or ""flattening the curve"" type response) has failed and that the death toll is far higher than accepted in a comparison nation.		

Does Sweden have a strict lockdown in response to COVID-19?		
- It goes too far to say Sweden has no lockdown in response to COVID-19. Sweden’s recommendations aren’t as strict as Norway’s and Denmark’s, but it is recommending social distancing.

Because of all the rain, massive flooding caused the Choluteca River to carve a new channel. The Choluteca River, which spanned hundreds of feet in width, no longer flowed under the bridge making the brand new Bridge of the Rising Sun obsolete.

139,T cells may play a role in the body’s immune response against the virus SARS-CoV-2,"Do T cells have a memory response to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19?		
New research shows that another component of the human immune response – T cells, which help orchestrate the antibody response – show memory for coronavirus infection when exposed to Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.		

Do T cells have a beneficial role in the body's immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus?		
T cells have been shown to have a beneficial role in long-term COVID-19 immunity. Evidence from various studies, including the Kusnadi et al. study published in January 2021 suggests that people with severe COVID-19 gain a stronger long-term immunity due to a higher number of protective memory T cells.		

What role do T cells play in the body's immune response against the virus SARS-CoV-2?		
in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2, and may mediate		

What type of immune cells, according to the evidence, play a role in the body's defense against the SARS-CoV-2 virus?		
(B) The adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus. T lymphocytes including CD4 + and CD8 + T cells play an important role in this defense.		

What role do T cells play in the body's immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus?		
We propose that T cells play a crucial role in the immunity against COVID-19, which provides a new direction-improvement of T cell number for advancing current prevention and treatment.		

What evidence supports the idea that T cells may play a role in the body's immune response against the virus SARS-CoV-2?		
Accumulating evidence supports a role for T cells in COVID-19 and probably in the immunological memory after SARS-CoV-2 infection.		

How long can the body retain immunity against SARS-CoV-2 due to the presence of T cells?		
Furthermore, it was shown that memory T cells against SARS-CoV-1 could be detected 17 years after exposure, which highlights the importance that T cells could have on the duration of protection [35].		

What role do T cells play in the body's immune response against the virus SARS-CoV-2?		
But, in fact, immune cells known as memory T cells also play an important role in the ability of our immune systems to protect us against many viral infections, including—it now appears—COVID-19.		

What is the current understanding of the role of T cells in the body's immune response against SARS-CoV-2?		
Similarly, the role of host immune responses in viral clearance of COVID-19 remains unresolved. For SARS-CoV (2002/03), however, it has been reported that CD4+ T cell responses correlated with positive outcomes3,4, whereas T cell immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been characterized.		

What role do T cells play in the body's immune response to viral infections like SARS-CoV-2?		
T cells are vital to the immune system’s ability to detect and kill virus-infected cells. In healthy individuals, virus-specific T cells form a critical component of the body’s natural defense system and provide protection against thousands of disease-causing viruses.

According to Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque, the opposition is “resorting to politicking” in saying that the government failed to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, noting how the country beat the University of the Philippines’ projection of 3.5-million cases (Aguilar, 2020).

According to Harry Roque, what is the threshold of COVID-19 cases in the country that would not be considered a loss?		
“Based on the current number of cases in the Philippines (including uncategorized cases) and assuming the trends continue, this projects to more than 60,000 COVID-19 cases by July 31, with 1,300 deaths,” the experts said.		

Is Harry Roque suggesting that the number of COVID-19 cases in the Philippines is not significant compared to the global number of cases?		
MANILA, Philippines — Filipinos should consider that other COVID-19 cases are also rising abroad, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said, as he cautioned against having a ""wrong view"" of the cases in the Philippines—which recorded over 6,000 additional patients on Tuesday night and 3,000 more the night before, the Palace said Wednesday.

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque, in a separate briefing, said recent cases had not exceeded 300.		

According to Harry Roque, what is the threshold of COVID-19 cases in the country that would not be considered a loss?		
Dismissing insinuations that the shortcomings of the government — not the people’s “lack of discipline,” as he previously claimed — placed the Philippines among SEA countries with the highest COVID-19 cases, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque, in his April 20 briefing, said:		

Does Harry Roque believe that 10,000 deaths would be a significant loss in the context of 10 million COVID-19 cases in the country?		
According to the Philippine government, as of Monday, the number of COVID-19 infection cases in this southeast Asian country rose to 11,086, including 726 deaths and 1,999 recoveries.		

Does Harry Roque consider 10 million COVID-19 cases in the country as a significant loss?

However, looking at those numbers alone is misleading, lacking context about the overall state of the economy, which hasn’t recovered from sharp job loss earlier in the year.		

Is the USA experiencing an increase in job numbers as suggested by the recent data on employment?		
On the one hand, the agency’s current forecast of output and employment may be too pessimistic. For example, recent data on employment show that hiring remains strong; moreover, many newly hired workers were previously not classified as being in the labor force, so the labor force participation rate has increased without an increase in the unemployment rate.		

How much higher was the actual unemployment rate compared to the reported level in June?		
However, the BLS said that discrepancy ""declined considerably"" in June, making the actual unemployment rate only about 1 percentage point higher than the reported level.		

What is the current state of the American labor market according to the September employment data?		
With a 50-year low for the unemployment rate and consistent job gains, the September employment data make it clear that the American labor market remains historically strong.		

Is the unemployment rate in the USA undercounting the number of jobless Americans?		
Likewise, the unemployment rate, which comes from a survey of households, probably undercounts the number of jobless Americans, too.

CLAIM: “the green house gasses that have been emitted into the ocean over that last 150 years would still be releasing slowly and causing more and more holes in the ozone layer as time goes on … the ozone layer has holes in it causing global temperature to rise.		

What are the substances that cause holes in the stratospheric ozone layer?		
Factually inaccurate: Chlorofluorocarbons, halons, and other ozone-depleting substances cause holes in the stratospheric ozone layer, not the greenhouse gas CO2, which was referred to in the post by stating it is emitted into the ocean.		

What is the relationship between greenhouse gases and the formation of holes in the ozone layer?		
The greenhouse effect and ozone hole issues are, however, related. For example, CFCs are involved in both issues: CFCs, in addition to destroying stratosphere ozone, are also greenhouse gases.		

What is the relationship between greenhouse gases emitted into the ocean and the rise in global temperatures?		
While ozone can affect climate, the rise in global temperature is the result of human-caused emissions of CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, and other greenhouse gases that trap and re-emit infra-red radiation, not by causing holes in the ozone layer as claimed (see figure below)[1,3,4].		

How do greenhouse gases contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer?		
Emissions of greenhouse gases can affect the depletion of the ozone layer through atmospheric interaction.		

What is the effect of greenhouse gases emitted into the ocean on the ozone layer?		
In addition to depleting the ozone layer, these substances are also potent greenhouse gases (GHGs) that contribute to climate change when emitted to the atmosphere.		

Does the evidence support the claim that greenhouse gases emitted into the ocean are causing more holes in the ozone layer?		
Fourth, a damaged ozone layer does NOT result in more global warming. The increase of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere is the leading cause of global warming.		

What is the indirect relationship between the depletion of the ozone layer and the increase in global temperatures?		
There is an additional factor that indirectly links ozone depletion to climate change; namely, many of the same gases that are causing ozone depletion are also contributing to climate change.		

What are some greenhouse gases that can cause damage to the ozone layer and contribute to global warming?		
When released into the atmosphere, CFCs and other halocarbons deplete the ozone layer and have high global warming potential.

We rate the claim that COVID-19 may have originated in a Chinese lab as PARTLY FALSE. Suggestions that the novel coronavirus was engineered for use in bioweapons in a high-security biomedical laboratory in Wuhan, China, were debunked, based on scientific research since the virus began its global spread.

Is the scientific consensus that the coronavirus is not a lab-engineered bioweapon supported by the genetic data?		
The scientific consensus rejecting the virus being engineered is almost unanimous.

But the ban applies to only some programs; most legal immigrants have been in the country long enough to qualify for at least some programs and the bar often does not apply to children; states often provide welfare to new immigrants on their own; naturalizing makes immigrants eligible for all programs; and, most important, immigrants (including illegal immigrants) can receive benefits on behalf of their U.S.-born children who are awarded U.S. citizenship at birth.		

Do immigrants in the country illegally qualify for federal benefits?		
THE FACTS: Wrong country, wrong numbers, wrong description of legal status of the recipients. Besides that, immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally do not qualify for most federal benefits, even when they’re paying taxes, and those with legal status make up a small portion of those who use public benefits.		

Are undocumented immigrants eligible for welfare benefits under Biden's policy?		
Meanwhile, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Social Security and the vast majority of taxpayer-funded welfare programs like food stamps and cash assistance, according to Capps, the expert with the Migration Policy Institute.		

What types of benefits are available to immigrants in the country illegally under Biden's policy?		
They can receive schooling and emergency medical care but not welfare or food stamps. Under the 1996 welfare law, most government programs require proof of documentation, and even immigrants with documents cannot receive these benefits until they have been in the United States for more than five years.		

Are immigrants in the country illegally eligible for welfare benefits under Biden's policy?		
While many immigrants who are lawfully present in the United States are eligible for public benefits, there are restrictions based on citizenship and immigration status that limit their access to several federal means-tested programs.		

Does the Biden administration's policy restrict welfare benefits for immigrants in the country illegally?		
At present, the bar on illegal immigrants directly using welfare programs likely reduces their use of some programs, making some illegal immigrants reluctant to apply for welfare programs, even when their U.S.-born children are eligible.		

Are undocumented immigrants eligible to receive welfare benefits under the current U.S. policy?		
Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for public benefits, and legal immigrants can receive benefits only once they have been a citizen for five years.		

Did non-citizens have access to welfare benefits prior to the 1996 reforms?		
On the one hand, those who support welfare benefits for non-citizens point out that at the time of the 1996 reforms, legal non-citizens enjoyed access to a wide range of welfare benefits.		

Are illegal immigrants eligible for welfare benefits under U.S. law?		
One reason why immigrants use fewer benefits is because they are often not eligible for them. Legal immigrants cannot get welfare for their first five years of residency, with few exceptions, mostly at the state level.		

Are immigrants in the country illegally eligible for federal welfare benefits under current U.S. law?

Some laboratories provide tests such as polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) tests, which can detect very small amounts of the virus but no unique genetic sequence associated with FIP has been identified.		

Does the PCR test for coronavirus detect the presence of the virus in the blood, rather than crossing the blood-brain barrier?		
It looks for the genetic material of the coronavirus. The test uses a technology called PCR (polymerase chain reaction), which greatly amplifies the viral genetic material if it is present.		

Does the PCR test for coronavirus involve piercing the blood-brain barrier?		
The first type is the one that usually involves taking a throat swab. This uses polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques to detect the Sars-CoV-2 RNA genetic code.

Polymerase chain reaction tests — PCR tests — are a type of nucleic acid test. These tests detect the presence of the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.		

Does the PCR test for coronavirus involve copying genetic material from a nasal swab to identify markers for COVID-19 infection?		
The gold standard for covid-19 testing is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. In a PCR test, genetic material collected in a nasal swab is copied millions or billions of times over so that markers for covid-19 infection can be identified (the virus’s RNA is too tiny to identify on its own, but making more copies makes it easier to find).		

What does the PCR testing technique do?

Did CERT-in specifically mention that the phishing attack they warned about was sponsored by the Chinese army?		
commonly used to refer to any targeted email attack, not limited to phishing. 		

Did CERT-in issue a warning about a phishing attack sponsored by the Chinese army?		
The question is how to generate phishing awareness and train your team to spot a phishing email. There are numerous types of phishing, but ultimately it is any type of attack by email that is designed to result in the recipient taking a specific course of action.		

Is there any evidence to suggest that the phishing attack warned about by CERT-in was sponsored by the Chinese army?		
A phishing attack is a scam and an effort to steal your personal information. Phishing attacks typically come in the form of fraudulent email messages that appear to have come from a legitimate source, such as your university or bank.		

How does a phishing attack typically bypass user suspicion?		
- Trust: By appearing to originate from a source that the user knows and trusts, phishing attacks bypass any suspicion about incoming email.		

According to the evidence, which unit of the Chinese military was responsible for the phishing attack that CERT-in issued a warning about?		
They have traced these to the Chinese military itself. An April 2009 cable even pinpoints the attacks to a specific unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Is there a correlation between COVID-19 infection and an increased risk of blood clotting?		
Blood clots appear to be associated with a higher risk of dying from COVID-19. Likewise, elevated markers of blood clotting are associated with an increased risk of admission to the intensive care unit and a worse prognosis overall.		

Does COVID-19 lead to severe blood clotting that persists?		
In patients with COVID-19 the clotting appears to be especially severe, and, based on previous research, the clots don’t dissipate.		

Are hospitals taking a preventative measure to reduce the risk of blood clotting in COVID-19 patients?		
The link between COVID-19 and clots has led some hospitals to put all COVID-19 patients on low doses of blood thinners to prevent clots, according to CNN.

Knowing that COVID-19 is linked to abnormal blood clots also points to potential short-term treatments, so fewer patients die of blood clots that lead to organ failure.		

Is the relationship between COVID-19 and blood clotting a matter of prevention or a direct cause?		
However, many blood clots in COVID-19 are occurring despite the use of low-dose blood thinners. As such, it is a question of intense discussion whether people admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19 should receive a higher-than-usual dose of blood thinners to prevent blood clots and improve clinical outcomes.		

What is one of the effects of COVID-19 on the body?		
In addition, COVID-19 appears to cause tiny blood clots that can block small vessels in the lungs. These “micro” blood clots may be a key reason why patients with COVID-19 often have very low oxygen levels.		

Does COVID-19 increase the risk of blood clotting?

718,Corona Virus is less likely to spread in a retail setting because people are moving around frequently and not just sitting or standing indoors for long periods of time during Worships.,"Does the movement of people in a retail setting reduce the potential for airborne transmission of the Corona Virus?		
Therefore, unless adequate precautions are taken, the longer a space is occupied and the more people that are present, the greater the potential for airborne transmission of the virus (See also Key References on Indoor Air and COVID-19).		

Does the movement and frequent change of position in a retail setting reduce the likelihood of people coughing, sneezing, or generating respiratory droplets towards others, thereby reducing the spread of COVID-19?		
Keep in mind the ways COVID-19 is transmitted. When assessing the risk of direct transmission, ask: How likely are people to cough, sneeze, or generate respiratory droplets toward others?		

What is the typical environment in which the COVID-19 virus is likely to spread?		
We know that coronavirus spreads through close and sustained contact with someone who is infected with the virus and so office environments, for instance, are a place where the virus could spread.		

What precautions should be taken in retail settings where social distancing is not possible?		
Where social distancing is not possible in the normal course of business activities, extreme care should be taken to reduce the risk of exposure to, and transmittal of, germs and COVID-19. . .

The virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings, where people tend to spend longer periods of time.		

What factors can help control the transmission of the Corona Virus?		
In addition, physical distancing, wearing masks, and avoidance of crowded indoor spaces can play a role in controlling transmission of the virus.		

Does frequent movement and reduced congregation in a retail setting reduce the likelihood of COVID-19 transmission?		
Social distancing can reduce virus transmission by increasing physical distance or reducing frequency of congregation in socially dense community settings, such as schools or workplaces.		

What is the recommended way to maintain good ventilation in a retail setting to prevent the spread of the Corona Virus?		
Ventilation is also enhanced by maintaining sufficient spacing between occupants. When employees return to their offices, it will be important that they remain spread out and are not confined in small areas for long periods of time, as this could lead to inadequate ventilation.		

How long can people safely interact with each other while standing 2 meters apart in a retail setting to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission?		
Additionally, the amount of infectious material needed for COVID-19 transmission is not clear, nor is the effect of duration of exposure on risk, making it unclear how long two people standing 2 meters apart may safely interact.

Can workplaces and supermarkets in New Zealand bar people who haven’t installed the COVIDsafe app on their phone?		
The claim is misleading; as of May 27, the app named in the posts is not a contact tracing app and is not being used by New Zealand's government as part of its coronavirus strategy; to date, the government's only coronavirus contact tracing app is voluntary for businesses and the public; shops in New Zealand are also not required to record consumer information for contact tracing purposes.

For this reason CDC monitors influenza activity levels and trends and virus characteristics through a nationwide surveillance system and uses statistical modeling to estimate the burden of flu illness (including hospitalizations and deaths) in the United States.		

Is the CDC no longer reporting flu deaths?		
CDC feels it is important to convey the full burden of seasonal flu and thus uses well-established scientific methods that have been reviewed by scientists outside of CDC to make comprehensive estimates of the total numbers of annual flu illnesses, flu-associated hospitalizations, and flu-associated deaths that occur each year.		

How does the CDC estimate flu deaths in the United States?		
As it does for the numbers of flu cases, doctor’s visits and hospitalizations, CDC also estimates deaths in the United States using mathematical modeling.		

What is the current method used by the CDC to estimate seasonal flu-related deaths?		
More information about how CDC estimates seasonal flu-related deaths is available.		

Is the CDC still reporting flu deaths, despite the low number of reported cases?		
However, CDC uses a mathematical model to estimate the number of influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths that occur each season (5).		

Does the CDC rely on statistical models to estimate flu-related cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the US?		
For these reasons, surveillance data may drastically underrepresent the true burden of flu in the U.S. To gain a better understanding of the actual burden of flu CDC and other public health agencies in the U.S. and other countries use statistical models to estimate the annual number of seasonal flu-related cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.		

What method does the CDC use to determine flu deaths in the US?		
- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) uses trends from past years to come up with a ""regional baseline"" rate of doctors' office visits for illness consistent with flu.

How many children in the U.S. have died as a result of COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention?		
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that at least three children in the U.S. have died as a result of COVID-19 and that infants can be vulnerable to severe infections.		

How do children under the age of 18 compare to adults in terms of experiencing symptoms and outcomes of COVID-19, according to the latest Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report report by the CDC?		
That trend, which doctors in China first reported, seems to be holding true in the U.S. as well. In the latest Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report report released today by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), scientists say that compared to adults, children under the age of 18 are less likely to experience the typical symptoms of infection, including fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and are also less likely to need hospitalization and less likely to die of COVID-19.		

What is the age distribution of children who have been infected with COVID-19 in the U.S.?

826,"Without Donald Trump's China travel ban, millions would have died of coronavirus","Did the travel restrictions imposed by Donald Trump slow the spread of the coronavirus in China by only three days?		
- Because there were far more cases of coronavirus than officially reported, the travel restrictions only slowed the outbreak's spread in China by three days, the research found.		

What was the first U.S. action taken to prevent the spread of the coronavirus from China?		
After the novel coronavirus was detected in Wuhan, China in December, the first U.S. action to prevent the virus from entering the United States was taken on January 31, when President Donald Trump issued a proclamation to block the entry of any foreign national who had been present in China in the preceding 14 days.		

Did the Chinese authorities' nationwide travel ban, which was implemented before Donald Trump's China travel ban, avert over 700,000 COVID-19 cases within China?		
As early as January 23, Chinese authorities declared a nationwide travel ban, which, some experts suggest, may have averted over 700,000 COVID-19 cases within the country.		

Would the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases outside of Wuhan have been higher without the Wuhan travel ban?		
“Our analysis suggests that without the Wuhan travel ban and the national emergency response, there would have been more than 700,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases outside of Wuhan by that date,” says Prof. Dye.

Would Donald Trump's China travel ban have prevented millions of people from arriving in the U.S. from China after the outbreak was disclosed?		
Even then, these vital restrictions were not taken seriously. Recent estimates suggest that 430,000 people arrived in the U.S. from China after the outbreak was disclosed, including around 40,000 after Trump's so-called travel ban.		

Did Donald Trump's China travel ban stop people from traveling from China to the US?		
But it’s not too early to say that American travel bans didn’t actually stop travel from China. More than 430,000 people traveled from China to over 17 American cities after the virus was discovered but before the ban; another 40,000 people arrived to the US from China after the ban went into place.		

Did the Wuhan travel ban imposed by China delay the spread of the coronavirus?		
By the time China instituted a ban on travel to and from Wuhan City on Jan. 23, most Chinese cities had already received travelers infected with the coronavirus now known as COVID-19, according to a new study that found the Wuhan travel ban may have only delayed the epidemic’s spread by three to five days in mainland China.		

At the time of the announcement of the travel ban, how many confirmed cases of coronavirus were there in the U.S.?		
""Even though there had only been 12 confirmed cases in the U.S. on the day President Trump announces the travel ban, the reality was there were many more unconfirmed cases.""		

What action did Donald Trump take regarding travel from China on January 31?		
Trump and his supporters defend his actions by noting that he announced a travel ban on non-U.S. citizens coming from China on January 31 effective February 2, and that the CDC began screening passengers from Wuhan and imposing quarantines on January 17.

According to recent evidence, the diagnostic accuracy of many of the currently available RT-PCR tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 may be lower than optimal (i.e. <100%).		

Is the RT-PCR test used for detecting Covid-19?		
Given the seriousness of the disease, we need to find quick ways to limit the spread of the virus. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is the current gold standard diagnostic method for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and is considered one of the modern techniques until now for managing the current outbreak to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections.		

Is the RT-PCR test capable of detecting Covid-19?

Polymerase chain reaction testing detects the presence of the virus, not antibodies to the virus; thus, the detection of viral DNA may be indicative of an active infection (Randhawa et al, 2005).		

Is the RT-PCR test used to confirm the presence of Covid-19, rather than to detect it?		
RT-PCR may be used as a confirmatory test and is particularly useful for intra vitam diagnosis in humans.

Does David Icke's claim that Microscope images of exosomes and of the virus that causes Covid-19 are ""exactly the same"" align with the scientific understanding of the differences between exosomes and viruses?		
“What inherently separates vesicles and exosomes from viruses is that exosomes are not infectious,” Pegtel said.		

Does the similarity between exosomes and the virus that causes COVID-19 in microscope images support David Icke's claim?		
However, there are other types of extracellular vesicles, such as those that are produced by shedding from the plasma membrane, and at present there is no standard way of specifically purifying exosomes.		

How were the images of exosomes and the virus that causes Covid-19 compared in order to make the claim that they are ""exactly the same""?		
To observe detailed structure, ultrathin sectioned images and negative stained images of exosomes were compared.		

Do exosomes and the virus that causes COVID-19 have similar molecular content?		
They contain a variety of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. In many cases, the molecular content is highly reflective of the cells that secreted the exosome.		

Are exosomes similar in appearance to the virus that causes COVID-19, according to the research published in Nature on July 9, 2015?		
Exosomes are released by cells and circulate in blood. The research, which was partially funded by NCI, was published in Nature on July 9, 2015.		

What is the typical diameter of exosomes compared to other types of extracellular vesicles?		
We addressed this question in several ways. First, exosomes have the same diameter as ILVs, i.e., 30–100 nm diameter, while other types of extracellular vesicles are much more heterogeneous in size, often up to 1 μm in diameter.		

What are exosomes?		
At just 30-150 nanometers across, exosomes are small sacs that contain cells. Exosomes transfer and share information with other cells in your body.
