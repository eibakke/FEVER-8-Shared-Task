2,"In Nigeria … in terms of revenue share, 20% goes to the local government.","Kenya’s ex-prime minister Odinga mangles his numbers on government revenue share in Nigeria?		
After months of an often fractious stalemate, in September 2020 Kenya’s senate hammered out a deal on how revenue would be shared  between the country’s two levels of government.

In August, at the height of the deadlock, former prime minister Odinga returned to a familiar talking point to argue for establishing a third tier of government.

Building on this in an interview with Citizen TV, Odinga, who is also an African Union envoy, said Kenya could solve the recurring battle over how to share revenue if it looked to Nigeria for lessons.

Nigeria, he said, had a local, state and federal system of government. “In terms of revenue share, 20% of the revenue goes to the local, 35% goes to the state and 45% goes to the federal governments ... and it works perfectly well,” Odinga said.

3,Biden has pledged to stop border wall construction and give amnesty and health care to all illegal immigrants.,"When Joe Biden participated in an interview with the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, on August 6, 2020 did he say he would tear down the border wall, if he became president?		
No, there will not be another foot of wall constructed on my administration...  I’m going to make sure that we have border protection, but it’s going to be based on making sure that we use high-tech capacity to deal with it and at the ports of entry.		

If Joe Biden became president, what is his intention regarding health care for illegal immigrants?		
According to PolitiFact Fact Checker, a task force recommended that Biden extend Affordable Care Act coverage to immigrants illegally in the country who are protected from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and allowing additional immigrants illegally in the country to also buy health insurance, unsubsidized.
So the task force recommends allowing immigrants here illegally to get access to health care, including Affordable Care Act coverage. But being able to buy health insurance doesn’t amount to getting welfare.		

If Joe Biden became president, what is his intention regarding health care for illegal immigrants?		
On the question asked at the interview with the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, on August 6, 2020 :
Should undocumented immigrants also be able to get subsidized healthcare?
Biden replied:
If they are working in the United States of America and they are paying taxes, they should have access to healthcare.		

What is the common reference for amnesty in modern U.S. politics?		
The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, signed by President Ronald Reagan is the law which paved the way for immigrants who were in the country illegally to become lawful permanent residents if they met certain requirements.		

How has Biden referred to amnesty for undocumented people?		
First thing I’m going to do and I’ve already written, sent to the United States Congress a path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented folks.

Eugenics is the practice or advocacy of improving the human species by selectively mating people with specific desirable hereditary traits. It aims to reduce human suffering by “breeding out” disease, disabilities and so-called undesirable characteristics from the human population		

What were Sangers views on eugenics?		
I think the greatest sin in the world is bringing children into the world -- that have disease from their parents, that have no chance in the world to be a human being practically. Delinquents, prisoners, all sorts of things just marked when they're born. That to me is the greatest sin -- that people can -- can commit		

Was Sanger a racist?		
As her biographer Ellen Chesler told me, she was a progressive who believed in racial integration. She voted for Norman Thomas. She worked with progressive Black people—W.E.B. Du Bois, for example, who along with Mary McCleod Bethune and Adam Clayton Powell Sr. served on the board of the Negro Project, a network of birth control and maternal health clinics Sanger established in Harlem and the South. In 1966, Martin Luther King accepted Planned Parenthood’s first Margaret Sanger Award, and in his statement offered a vigorous endorsement of voluntary birth control.		

Was Sanger a eugenicist?		
Although she did not single out Black people, Sanger was, yes, a eugenicist. She thought people, especially poor people, often had too many kids to care for properly and that too many of those kids were born physically disabled (or in the language of the day, “feeble-minded”). She did not oppose forced sterilization.

It also found an increase in wellbeing but “no large change in risk of depression.”		

Is this study backed up by further research?		
There’s nothing wrong with this study in terms of its method or what it claims, but it shouldn’t necessarily be taken to represent the experience of all children across the country. 

It can’t rule out the possibility that the mental toll of the pandemic may have been different across different parts of the country, and for people of different ages. 

For example, a study out of the University of Oxford, asked parents and carers to report any changes in behavior of their children during a one-month period in lockdown. It found that while parents and carers reported that the emotional difficulties of adolescents decreased, the emotional difficulties of children aged four to ten increased. 

Also a potential contributor to feelings of anxiety among students during the pandemic has been the uncertainty over exam results, which would have primarily affected students in years 11 and 13, not year 9 (as the study itself notes).

It thus vests the President with “ample power” to 
impose entry restrictions in addition to those elsewhere enumerated
in the INA. Sale, 509 U. S., at 187. The Proclamation falls well within this comprehensive delegation. The sole prerequisite set forth in
§1182(f) is that the President “find[ ]” that the entry of the covered aliens “would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.”		

Was President Trump's January 2018 travel ban lawful?		
Yes, The President has lawfully exercised the broad discretion granted to him under §1182(f) to suspend the entry of aliens into the United States. Pp. 9–24.		

Why was a travel ban placed on these countries?		
The Proclamation placed entry restrictions
on the nationals of eight foreign states whose systems for managing
and sharing information about their nationals the President deemed
inadequate. Foreign states were selected for inclusion based on a review undertaken pursuant to one of the President’s earlier Executive
Orders. As part of that review, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in consultation with the State Department and intelligence
agencies, developed an information and risk assessment “baseline.”
DHS then collected and evaluated data for all foreign governments,
identifying those having deficient information-sharing practices and
presenting national security concerns, as well as other countries “at
risk” of failing to meet the baseline.		

Has the travel ban been challenged?		
Yes, The American Civil Liberties Union and other partner organizations filed a federal lawsuit challenging President Trump’s Muslim ban executive order, charging it violates the Constitution — including the First Amendment’s prohibition of government establishment of religion and the Fifth Amendment’s guarantees of equal treatment under the law — and federal laws.

He often follows up with a remark indicating he is “joking,” “kidding,” or saying it to drive the “fake” news media “crazy.” Even if Trump thinks that he’s only “joking,” the comments fit a broader pattern that raises the prospect that Trump may not leave office quietly in the event he’s on the losing end of a very close election. And unfortunately this possibility is only one of a number of potential election meltdowns we may face in November.

121,Russia has successfully developed a vaccine for Covid-19 and it has passed all checks.,"Who has developed this vaccine?		
‘Sputnik V’ has been developed by Moscow-based Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology.		

When was it first registered?		
It was registered by the Russian health ministry on August 11 as the first registered Covid-19 vaccine in the market but The certificate mentions that “the vaccine cannot be used widely until 1 January 2021”, presumably after larger clinical trials are completed.		

What kind of vaccine is it?		
The Russian vaccine is an “adenovirus vector-based vaccine”.

The idea is to use the weakened common cold virus to stimulate an immune response and trigger the formation of antibodies against Covid-19. These anti-bodies are then ready to fight against Covid-19 in case one catches a coronavirus infection. Even the widely awaited Oxford University vaccine is exploring the same route.		

Has it been thoroughly tested?		
No, First, the vaccine has been approved even before the vital Phase 3 trial started on August 12. According to the ‘Sputnik V’ website, “Phase 3 clinical trial involving more than 2,000 people in Russia, a number of Middle Eastern (UAE and Saudi Arabia), and Latin American countries (Brazil and Mexico) will start on August 12. Mass production of the vaccine is expected to start in September 2020.”

The website also says that “emergency rules adopted during the Covid-19 pandemic can be used to vaccinate the population in Russia”.		

Has it been tested for safety?		
No, The second problem is that even for the just-concluded Phase 2 of trial, the sample size was too small for fair evaluation about the safety and efficacy. All the data about the testing has not been made public yet. According to “Science” magazine, so far, it has only been tested on 76 people in total

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), SARS-CoV-2 is still mainly transmitted through respiratory secretions or droplets that can reach the mouth, nose and eyes of someone who comes in close contact with a COVID-19-infected person.		

How is covid-19 primarily transmitted?		
Indirect transmission may also occur when infected respiratory droplets land on objects or surfaces creating fomites, where SARS-CoV-2 could stay viable for hours or days depending on the environment. However, WHO noted in its latest scientific brief that no specific reports demonstrate fomite transmission of the virus.		

Can COVID-19 be transmitted through airborne transmission?		
Yes, WHO and the U.S. CDC also acknowledged increasing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can spread through airborne transmission, but current evidence shows that it only occurs in indoor spaces with poor ventilation. WHO said further studies are needed to establish if airborne transmission may occur in the absence of aerosol-generating procedures.

SARS-CoV-2 can become airborne when tiny droplets called droplet nuclei or aerosols containing it get suspended in the air, according to a global team of public health experts convened by international non-profit media group Meedan. Droplet nuclei are microscopic and much smaller in size than respiratory droplets (almost five to 10 micrometers), according to WHO.

Trump issued a memo that told employers they didn’t need to send Washington the 6.2% out of each employee’s paycheck that helps fund Social Security. So, someone making $1,000 a week — the national median pay — could see an extra $62 every week. The tax break applies to people making up to $2,000 a week and would be in place for four months, September through December.		

Why would the tax deferral potentially cost people money during the tax season?		
The more a person makes, up to the maximum, the more money they would keep. At the high end, a person could see a tax cut of $1,984 over those 16 weeks.

Trump had the power to defer collecting the tax, but as written, his order provided only temporary relief. At some point, the missed payments would need to be made up or count as foregone revenues to the Social Security trust fund. The memo said the administration will look for a way to let people keep the money, but that decision rests with Congress, not the president.

139,T cells may play a role in the body’s immune response against the virus SARS-CoV-2,"What are T cells role in clearing viral infections?		
T cells recognize and kill infected cells. The cells of the adaptive immune system are lymphocytes – B cells and T cells. A key feature of the adaptive immune system is memory. Repeat infections by the same virus are met immediately with a strong and specific response that usually effectively stops the infection with less reliance on the innate system. When we say we are immune to infection with a virus, we are talking about immune memory. Vaccines protect us against infection because of immune memory. The first adaptive response against a virus – called the primary response – often takes days to mature. In contrast, a memory response develops within hours of infection. Memory is maintained by a subset of B and T lymphocytes called memory cells which survive for years in the body. Memory cells remain ready to respond rapidly and efficiently to a subsequent encounter with a pathogen. This so-called secondary response is often stronger than the primary response to infection. Consequently, childhood infections protect adults, and immunity conferred by vaccination can last for years.		

What does the National Geographic article say that specifically relates to the role of T cells for the SARS-CoV-2 virus?		
The article references findings by Aleman, a researcher and physician at the Karolinska University in sweden.
Killer T cells, which tell virus-infected human cells to destroy themselves to keep the virus from spreading - In a subset of those who tested positive for COVID-19, Aleman found T cells but no antibodies. Aleman says, one thing is becoming clear: antibodies might not be telling the whole story when it comes to COVID-19 immunity. “We shouldn’t just look blindly at antibody tests."" The article also states, Aleman and other virologists and immunologists when turning their attention to COVID-19, they began to study how immunity developed in people who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, as well as their close contacts, some of whom were presumably exposed to the virus, even if they didn’t get sick. As expected, hospitalized individuals developed strong antibody and T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2. But two-thirds of the close contacts who were asymptomatic showed a subsequent T cell response, even though tests didn’t detect any antibodies - Study results, released June 29 without peer review via the medical pre-print service medRxiv, didn’t reveal whether these individuals never developed antibodies or whether they rapidly declined to undetectable levels. Regardless, the report immediately raised concerns about a vaccine, since stimulating antibody production is a key strategy by which immunizations protect against disease.

The article also cites recently reported work by immunologist Antonio Bertoletti from Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore - Patients infected with the original SARS virus still possessed memory T cells that responded to the virus’ proteins 17 years later. These same memory T cells also reacted to SARS-CoV-2. It’s something Bertoletti says bodes well for COVID-19.		

What reaction did the claim recieve from the scientific community?

Masks will be made mandatory for anyone in England wanting to use public transport, including the Tube, buses and trains from 15 June onwards.

Travellers will be refused access to public transport if they do not comply with these rules, which have been put in place to reduce the spread of coronavirus, as more people head back to work.

The government has said face coverings should be worn on trains, underground trains, buses, ferries and planes. But people won’t have to wear them inside railway stations or at bus terminals. UK transport secretary Grant Shapps said tonight: “I can announce that as of Monday 15 June, face coverings will become mandatory on public transport.

“The evidence suggests that wearing a face mask offers some, limited protection. It’s a condition of travel. You cannot travel if you are not wearing a face covering.”

However, there will be exemptions for anyone with breathing difficulties and young children.		

Are there people exempted from the use of face masks face coverings on buses?		
You do not need to wear a face covering if you have a legitimate reason not to or are exempt on other grounds - these include the following:

    not being able to put on, wear or remove a face covering because of a physical or mental illness or impairment, or disability
    if you have a medical condition that prevents you from wearing a mask such as respiratory illness
    if putting on, wearing or removing a face covering will cause you severe distress
    if you are travelling with or providing assistance to someone who relies on lip reading to communicate
    to avoid harm or injury, or the risk of harm or injury, to yourself or others
    to avoid injury, or to escape a risk of harm, and you do not have a face covering with you
    to eat or drink, but only if you need to and replace your face covering as soon as possible
    to take medication
    if a police officer or other official requests you remove your face covering
    a child who is under the age of 11
    any employee of the operator, or anyone contracted to provide a service on behalf of the operator who is performing their duty - although as mentioned above, reasonable alternative measures should be in place unless not possible to do so.
    a member of the emergency services who are performing their duties

Please remember that there may be people on the list above who are exempt from wearing a face covering. Not all reasons are visible so please be mindful of others who may not be wearing a mask for a legitimate reason. 

Operators such as ourselves have been given discretion on how they enforce the new requirement to wear a face covering with the preferred method being “engage, explain, encourage”. Our drivers are not police officers and so are not there to enforce the law, but by following the Government guidelines, we are trying to engage people to explain the new law and then encourage them to wear face coverings in future.

It’s hard to argue that extremely sick people, let alone dead people, had been obscured by low levels of testing but suddenly revealed by higher levels.

Without a doubt, many cases of Covid-19 in March, April, and May weren’t picked up. In late June, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield told reporters that as many as 90% of cases had been missed; that is, although there were 2.3 million confirmed cases in the U.S. then, some 20 million people had probably been infected. But that reasoning applies today, too: Despite months of government claims to the contrary, not everyone who wants, or should have, a test is getting one. Using data from Covid Tracking, STAT looked at the number of people tested and the number who tested positive for the disease (cases) in every state and Washington, D.C. We did that for three dates: in mid-May, mid-June, and mid-July. (Due to reporting anomalies, the dates selected sometimes differed by a day or two between states.)

For each date, we calculated the number of cases found per 1,000 tests — a measure of the disease’s prevalence. For example, in Florida on May 13, that rate was 32. On June 13 it was 75. On July 13 it was 193. On May 13, Florida tested 15,159 people; on July 13, it tested 65,567. So indeed, the number of tests has increased.

156,You can test too much for Covid-19.,"Can you overtest for COVID-19?		
Frequent testing of the entire population would help identify so-called hidden hidden carriers — individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, but who have no symptoms of it. They seem to play an important role in the spread of Covid-19. Identifying these silent spreaders could help public health workers be more effective at contract tracing by identifying others who have been exposed and may require quarantine.		

What are the downsides of overtesting for COVID-19?		
There are also the harms of Covid-19 testing to consider.

Perhaps the biggest challenge is false negatives — tests signaling no infection in those who are indeed infected. Covid-19 testing is typically performed on samples from behind the nose or in the back of the mouth, and will be positive only if the sample happens to contain the virus. In some people, the virus may be present in high quantities only deep in the lungs. False negatives occur surprisingly often — perhaps as often as one-third of the time — which could lead to a false sense of security among those with such results.

Testing those without symptoms can also lead to false alarms. PCR testing for the virus, which is the best way to identify an active infection, can detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 — or remnants of it — for weeks, even when the infection is unlikely to be transmitted to others. Testing the entire population would undoubtedly identify a large number of such individuals, unnecessarily sidelining them from work and society.		

When should you get tested for COVID-19?		
You should always get tested when you have symptoms for COVID-19.

You should also get tested when you’ve had close contact with someone who has Covid. Test 3 to 5 days after your exposure. Testing earlier to find out if you’re positive is optional.

Also get tested when asked by your school, workplace, doctor, or the Department Public of Health.

Testing is a good idea before and after activities that put you or others at higher risk for Covid, like:

Large gatherings
Crowded indoor settings
Testing is also a good idea when you work somewhere with a higher risk of transmission, like:

Homeless shelters
Jails
Places where you have close contact with the public

157,Trump did more for the Black community than anybody with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln.,"What has Trump done for the black community?		
He earned a Promise Kept for his pledge to ensure funding for historically Black colleges and universities, or HBCUs. 

Trump signed the bipartisan FUTURE Act in 2019 to ensure that the original science, technology, engineering and math funding for HBCUs from President George W. Bush's 2007 College Cost Reduction and Access Act would continue to be awarded.		

Where do historians rank Trump in relation to his achievements for the black community?		
While Trump has made this assertion before, historians disagree. Right behind Lincoln, who prosecuted the Civil War and issued the Emancipation Proclamation, would be President Lyndon B. Johnson.

Johnson, a skilled legislator from his years in the Senate, deliberately crafted his agenda and pushed it through Congress with personal persuasion, to a far greater degree than Trump, historians say.

""His accomplishments on behalf of African Americans — the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, the Fair Housing Act — were historic,"" said University of Texas historian H.W. Brands.

Jeffrey A. Engel, director of Southern Methodist University’s Center for Presidential History, sees Johnson and President Harry Truman, who moved to desegregate the military, as being among recent presidents who were ahead of their times.

Even a president like Richard Nixon, who was captured on tape making racist remarks, had a fairly robust legacy on civil rights, advancing the desegregation of schools and affirmative action in employment, said John J. Pitney, Jr., a Claremont McKenna College political scientist.

170,"""Depending on which study you look at,"" he said, ""either 68% or 5 out of 6 individuals ... are making more on unemployment than they did on the job.""","What proportion of unemployed Americans receive benefits that exceed their lost earnings?		
68%		

What are unemployed individuals earning that means they are earning more out of work than they would be in work?		
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) Act substantially expanded Unemploy-
ment Insurance (UI) in order to help workers losing jobs as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. One provision
of the Act creates an additional $600 weekly benefit known as the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Com-
pensation (FPUC). The size of the payment—$600—was designed to replace 100 percent of the mean U.S.
wage when combined with mean state UI benefits.		

What is the ratio between the unemployment benefits to mean pre-tax wages?		
As designed, the ratio of mean unemployment benefits to mean pre-tax wages under CARES is roughly
100%. However, this masks substantial heterogeneity. We find that 76% of unemployed workers have a
statutory replacement rate above 100%.		

Does this mean that some unemployed are earning more than they would be whilst in work?		
Yes, That means that three in four unemployed workers are eligible for
benefits which exceed their lost wages. The median statutory replacement rate is 145%. 69% of unemployed
workers have comprehensive replacement rates above 100% and so qualify for unemployment benefits which
exceed total post-payroll tax wages and non-wage compensation. The median comprehensive replacement
rate is 134%		

Why are some unemployed people now earning more than when they were in work?		
These conclusions arise because the CARES Act sends a fixed $600 supplement to unemployed workers
who have very different pre-job loss earnings: $600 is a larger percentage of pre-job loss earnings for low
than for high earners. The CARES Act implemented a fixed supplement to all workers in part because it
was viewed as infeasible to implement policies which depended on individual earnings. Since the $600 UI
supplement was targeted to generate 100% earnings replacement based on mean earnings, this $600 sup-
plement tends to imply greater than 100% earnings replacement for those with less than mean earnings.
Furthermore, these high replacement rates for below-mean workers are amplified by the fact that the dis-
tribution of earnings is skewed: median earnings are less than mean earnings. This means that the typical
unemployed worker has below-mean prior earnings and thus above-mean replacement rates. This implies
that most workers have replacement rates above 100%.

202,COVID Outbreak Discovered in Oregon Minks,"Can Mink contract Covid_19?		
Minks were infected following exposure from infected humans. Minks can act as a reservoir of SARS-CoV-2, passing the virus between them, and pose a risk for virus spill-over from mink to humans. People can then transmit this virus within the human population. Additionally, spill-back (human to mink transmission) can occur. It remains a concern when any animal virus spills in to the human population, or when an animal population could contribute to amplifying and spreading a virus affecting humans. As viruses move between human and animal populations, genetic modifications in the virus can occur. These changes can be identified through whole genome sequencing, and when found, experiments can study the possible implications of these changes on the disease in humans.		

Are minks susceptible to covid_19 ?

What happens when the link on the social posts with the claim that The New York state Labor Department is giving essential workers $4,800 in hazard pay is activated?		
A picture of a gorilla giving the camera a finger is received.		

How does the US Dept of Labor define hazard pay?		
The U.S. Department of Labor defines hazardous work as “[w]ork duty that causes extreme physical discomfort and distress which is not adequately alleviated by protective devices [and] is deemed to impose a physical hardship.”[Hazard pay is also forward looking pay that provides additional compensation in advance to mitigate the impacts of potential future harm.		

What authority is responsible for authorising hazard pay?		
The U.S. Department of Labor does not currently regulate hazard pay and does not require that employers provide hazard pay. An employee is only entitled to hazard pay either through an employment agreement, or in specific instances, where provided by statute.		

Who typically receives hazard pay?		
Federal statutes establish hazard pay for government employees whose duty involves “unusual physical hardship or hazard, and for any hardship or hazard related to asbestos” in an amount not to exceed 25 percent of the employee’s basic pay. However, in order to be entitled to the hazard pay incentive, the employee’s work must not be “in a position the classification of which takes into account the degree of physical hardship or hazard involved in the performance of the duties.” Workers whose positions are already known to be hazardous would not receive additional hazard pay.  The hazard entitling a federal worker to additional compensation must therefore be outside the hazards normally encompassed by the worker’s job description.		

Did the parameters change during the COVID-19 pandemic?		
With respect to COVID-19, federal employees whose job it is to work with deadly infectious diseases on a regular basis would likely not receive hazard pay under the statute.

216,Reports as recent as 2017 reported 92% prevalence of blood lead poisoning in children from some villages in the Nigerian state of Zamfara.,"Was there high level of child lead poisoning in Zamfara State Nigeria 2017 ?		
The World Health Organization (WHO), which has been assisting the Government in managing the situation, called for Nigerian authorities to increase their commitment to combat lead poisoning by strengthening its capacity to diagnose, treat and manage it, as well as ensuring that all areas have been de-contaminated.

In a news release, WHO warned that lead poisoning cannot be successfully eliminated without significant changes to mining practices, including the relocation of ore processing activities and storage of ore materials away from villages.

Other necessary measures recommended by WHO include the adoption of processing methods that produce less dust, and hygiene measures such as removing contaminated clothes and washing before returning home.

Lead poisoning damages the nervous system and causes brain and blood disorders. Treatment is time-consuming and expensive as it involves undergoing long-term therapy with chelating agents, which remove heavy metals from the body.

Treatment also involves persuading people to adopt new practices and behaviours, something which requires an ongoing effort from authorities to continuously raise awareness and make sure the population follows preventive measures.

According to WHO, children in seven villages in Zamfara state require chelation therapy. This is in addition to the residents of seven other villages who have already received treatment. In these villages the combined effects of removing children from lead exposure and providing chelation therapy caused the child mortality rate to drop from 43 per cent to 1 per cent in one year.

Since the problem was discovered last year, $1.9 million has been provided by the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to WHO and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), which have been used to provide treatment, train doctors, provide quick diagnoses, and raise awareness about the hazards of lead.		

Was there a 92% prevalence of blood lead poisoning in Zamfara  due to gold mining?		
No answer could be found.		

What was the reason behind  high levels of child lead poisoning in Zamfara State Nigeria?

What was the reason behind  high levels of child lead poisoning in Zamfara State Nigeria?		
The study eventually identified 131 villages of interest in the state through a chain-referral approach. It visited 74, taking blood and soil samples from 70.

The majority of the villages – 50 – had either childhood lead poisoning, lead contamination or both. The researchers said due to time constraints, they could not sample all villages of interest. They were also only able to survey five children in each village, which they said suggested they may have underestimated the extent. 

The researchers also found two-thirds of households surveyed processed gold ore inside their family compounds, with activities like breaking, drying, separating and washing ore associated with the deaths. The majority of gold mining activities in the state had started in the preceding year.

The outbreak was eventually linked to unsafe gold mining by artisanal and small-scale miners.		

Where did this figure come from?		
a 2013 study of 307 children below age six as the likely source of his claim. He said he may have mistaken this as being in 2017.

The study focused on a village in the Kawaye area of Anka local council in Zamfara. It recruited the children through random sampling to reduce bias. The researchers, who included the Ahmadu Bello University and the national and state health ministries,  found a 92.5% prevalence of lead poisoning, the same proportion as Abdulsalam’s claim.		

How does this study define lead poisoning?		
The study based its definition of childhood lead poisoning on US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, which give this as blood lead levels of 5 micrograms per deciliter or more. 

Some 34 of the children had elevated blood lead levels of up to 45 micrograms per deciliter.		

Do any other sources show similar results?		
Other studies also show high child lead poisoning levels in the state. In 2010, a deadly lead poisoning outbreak was reported in some areas of Zamfara. The state holds many of the gold mining leases in Nigeria.

In two of the most affected villages, 25% of children under age five had died in the past year.		

What did studies of the children affected show?		
In two of the most affected villages, 25% of children under age five had died in the past year. One of the first studies into the outbreak, done in mid-2010, found that as many as  eight in 10 of them had convulsions before death.

The researchers tested 204 children below age 5 in the two villages. All had lead levels higher or equal to 10 micrograms per decilitre, with 97% of them having levels higher or equal to 45 micrograms per decilitre.		

How dangerous is lower levels of lead in the blood?		
Even at low levels of 10 micrograms per deciliter or less, the immune, reproductive and cardiovascular systems of people are compromised by lead poisoning. In June 2010, a guideline value of an intake of 1 microgram per deciliter for lead was withdrawn after experts from the WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations found it inadequate to protect against diminished intelligence. 

Prof Udoh, the pharmacology and toxicology expert from the University of Calabar, agreed that based on this revised standard, the lead levels found in the blood of all the children tested during the 2010 study were harmful.

228,5G towers unleash severely damaging level of radiation to DNA,"Do the radio frequency waves from cell towers cause health problems?		
At this time, there’s no strong evidence that exposure to RF waves from cell phone towers causes any noticeable health effects.		

What type of radiation do RF waves produce?		
Like FM radio waves, microwaves, visible light, and heat, they are forms of non-ionizing radiation.		

Does non-ionizing radiation damage DNA?		
They do not directly damage the DNA inside cells, which is how stronger (ionizing) types of radiation such as x-rays, gamma rays, and ultraviolet (UV) rays are thought to be able to cause cancer.

229,Those most susceptible to the radiation from 5G technology are fetuses in utero and children.,"Are children susceptible to the radiation from 5G technology?		
Children have smaller heads than adults.  Cell phones and wireless radiation can go deeper into their brains because children have a shorter distance from their skull to their brain center.		

Are children susceptible to the radiation from 5G technology?		
In recent months, the network has run a series of segments critical of 5G technology. “The higher the frequency, the more dangerous it is to living organisms,” a RT reporter told viewers in March. The show described children as particularly vulnerable.		

Are fetuses in utero susceptible to the radiation from 5G technology?		
Cell-phone use has rapidly increased during the last several decades (1). Cell phones generate radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF), resulting in local exposure of the human body to RF-EMF. Concerns have been raised regarding the potential effects of RF-EMF exposure on human health. Short-term exposure in adults is regarded as safe; however, potential health effects of long-term exposure and exposure of fetuses and children are not well studied (2, 3).

The interpretation of results from epidemiologic studies evaluating health effects of RF-EMF exposure from cell-phone use is challenging. Because of the technical evolution of mobile communication systems, similar levels of cell-phone use do not necessarily induce similar levels of RF-EMF exposure. Users’ exposure to RF-EMF from third-generation (3G) devices is much lower than that from second-generation (2G) devices (4). More recent technologies (4G/5G) also differ from 3G devices, though less, in terms of users’ exposure.		

Does the radiation from 5G towers damage dna?		
Like FM radio waves, microwaves, visible light, and heat, they are forms of non-ionizing radiation. This means they do not directly damage the DNA inside cells, which is how stronger (ionizing)		

Is 5G dangerous to children?

“The best thing we could do is just get Mike Bloomberg in there,” he said.

After endorsing Mitt Romney and famously delivering a speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention to an empty chair that represented Barack Obama, Eastwood never officially backed Trump. In a 2016 interview, he expressed displeasure with Trump and Hillary Clinton, saying there’s “much funny business on both sides of the aisle.”

He praised Trump at the time because he was “onto something” and “secretly everybody’s getting tired of political correctness, kissing up.”

“We’re really in a p—y generation. Everybody’s walking on eggshells. We see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff. When I grew up, those things weren’t called racist,” he said.

Now, he’s changed his tune a bit on Trump.

While he approves of “certain things” the president has done, he wishes that he would act “in a more genteel way, without tweeting and calling people names. I would personally like for him to not bring himself to that level,” he said.

Eastwood also touched on the controversy surrounding Olivia Wilde’s character, Kathy Scruggs, in his 2019 film “Richard Jewell.” He showed Scruggs, the real-life reporter who alleged Jewell planted a bomb at the 1996 Olympics, sleeping with an FBI source to get information. Lawyers for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the newspaper at which Scruggs worked, called the portrayal “entirely false and malicious, and…extremely defamatory and damaging.” The film was Clintwood’s worst opening in 40 years.

The director defended his right to cinematic freedom and said the newspaper was trying to shroud its “guilt” over a “reckless story.”

Counties have made remarkable achievements towards the realization of 100 per cent
food and nutrition security. To achieve this, County Governments have focused on
improving both crop and animal productivity. Some of the key interventions are:
 Empowerment of farmers through mechanization of production systems
evidenced by the purchase of 366 tractors and equipping of 26 Agriculture
mechanization stations offering lease services to rural farmers.
 Distribution of over 2 Million 50-kgs bags of subsidized fertilizer.
 Under the County subsidies arrangements, 1400 greenhouses have also been
purchased and distributed to farmers in the year under review.
 Enhanced uptake of commercialized agriculture through construction of over 140
markets that provided direct access to markets for farmers
 Vaccination of 46 Million Livestock and construction of over 500 cattle dips that
has improved disease control and surveillance.
Provision of over 1 million recorded Artificial Insemination Services to livestock
farmers and purchase of over 300 Milk coolers distributed as input subsidies to
farmer’s co-operatives. In return this has enhanced animal productivity and value
addition on raw products.
 County Governments have allocated on average 6.7 % of their total budgets to the
Agriculture sector. This is just 3% less of the 10% recommended allocation as per
the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) Malabo
declaration. The achievement of the 10% required or more would be realized if the
devolved monies held at the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation, are
released to Counties. The Council will continue to pursue reforms in this sector to
ensure the best interest of the farmers in the Counties is achieved.

...bromine gases from human-produced chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons have destroyed ozone molecules.		

What causes holes in the ozone layer?		
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons have destroyed ozone molecules.		

Are the ozone holes causing the global temperature to rise?		
Because the ozone layer normally blocks ultraviolet (UV) light, an ozone hole allows more UV light than usual to reach the surface. However, the additional energy added to the Earth system from the ozone hole is so small that it couldn’t be responsible for the warming trend that’s been occurring.		

Are the ozone holes causing the global temperature to rise?		
...ozone depletion is not a major cause of climate change.		

What are the main causes of global warming?		
The main driver of climate change is the greenhouse effect. Some gases in the Earth's atmosphere act a bit like the glass in a greenhouse, trapping the sun's heat and stopping it from leaking back into space and causing global warming.

Many of these greenhouse gases occur naturally, but human activities are increasing the concentrations of some of them in the atmosphere, in particular:

carbon dioxide (CO2)
methane
nitrous oxide
fluorinated gases
CO2 produced by human activities is the largest contributor to global warming. By 2020, its concentration in the atmosphere had risen to 48% above its pre-industrial level (before 1750).

The main driver of climate change is the greenhouse effect. Some gases in the Earth's atmosphere act a bit like the glass in a greenhouse, trapping the sun's heat and stopping it from leaking back into space and causing global warming.		

Is chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) a greenhouse gas?		
Yes, Chlorofluorocarbons are exceptionally strong greenhouse gases and are also responsible for the destruction of stratospheric ozone.		

Is chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) a greenhouse gas?		
Yes, Chlorofluorocarbons are exceptionally strong greenhouse gases		

How is ozone depletion affecting climate change?		
Atmospheric ozone has two effects on the temperature balance of the Earth. It absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation, which heats the stratosphere. It also absorbs infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface, effectively trapping heat in the troposphere. Therefore, the climate impact of changes in ozone concentrations varies with the altitude at which these ozone changes occur. The major ozone losses that have been observed in the lower stratosphere due to the human-produced chlorine- and bromine-containing gases have a cooling effect on the Earth's surface. On the other hand, the ozone increases that are estimated to have occurred in the troposphere because of surface-pollution gases have a warming effect on the Earth's surface, thereby contributing to the ""greenhouse"" effect.		

What does the claim state that the ocean does to put holes into the ozone layer?		
The post states that greenhouse gases that are emitted into the ocean,  are then released by the ocean and effect the ozone layer.		

Are green house gasses what cause holes in the ozone layer?		
No, Greenhouse gasses (GHG's) are a gas that absorbs and emits radiant energy (heat)

We are grateful for this opportunity to address how each of our agencies and office are harnessing innovation to prevent, diagnose, and treat the novel coronavirus SARs-CoV-2.

COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. This new disease, officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO), is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses.  Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19.  Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated in animals and then spread to people.

Why has the Azerbaijan government threatened to bomb the nuclear plant in Armenia?		
The July 16 warning drew outrage from Yerevan and deepened concerns that the worst violence in four years between Azerbaijan and Armenia, who are technically still in a war begun in the late 1980s, could quickly spiral out of control.

At least 16 Azerbaijanis and Armenians have died in the fighting near a northern section of their internationally recognized border that has included heavy artillery, tank, and drone attacks since it began on July 12.

Yerevan and Baku routinely threaten and accuse the other of provocations that have killed dozens of people in recent years, many of them civilians, with neither side willing to back down publicly for fear of being viewed as weak in the more than 30-year-long standoff.

Yes, Among the biggest donors was the former Anadarko Oil and Gas. The company donated $25,000 to the governor’s office in 2017, just days after a deadly explosion in Firestone was tied to a leaking underground pipeline owned by the company. Over the course of four years, it gave the governor’s office more than $330,000, money for which there is little accounting.		

Had Anadarko Petroleum Corp donated to Hickenlooper’s administration prior to the Firestone accident?		
Yes, A Hickenlooper campaign spokesperson told us the company had already contributed nearly $219,000 to Hickenlooper’s administration prior to the Firestone accident.		

Is there evidence to suggest that the donated money by  Anadarko Petroleum Corp to Hickenlooper’s administration was a form of pay off?		
No, The analysis found no evidence that the donations were connected to official action taken by Hickenlooper’s administration.		

Is there evidence to suggest that the donated money by  Anadarko Petroleum Corp to Hickenlooper’s administration was a form of pay off?		
No, CBS4 found no evidence of a quid pro quo		

Did experts question whether it was possible that donated money by  Anadarko Petroleum Corp to Hickenlooper’s administration was a form of pay off?		
Yes, Frank Lamonte, Director of the Brechner Center for the Freedom of Information, said he’s never heard of direct donations to a governor’s office without oversight. “Big dollar presents like that are the exact kind of things that ethics laws seek to prohibit and regulate.”

While CBS4 found no evidence of a quid pro quo, Lamonte said the potential is certainly there. Lamonte calls the donations an end-run around campaign finance laws that come with limits and public disclosure, “Even if it’s well-intentioned and there is no influence buying going on, it just raises all sorts of red flags that it could influence the direction of policy and it could influence what legislation is prioritized, it could give, at least if not influence, it could give preferred access to the governor.”		

Could Anadarko officials have been prosecuted by Hickenlooper’s administration?		
No, As for no Anadarko officials being prosecuted, Sharon Jacobs, an associate professor at the University of Colorado School of Law, told us that would have been up to the state attorney general at the time — not Hickenlooper.		

Could Anadarko officials have been prosecuted by Hickenlooper’s administration?		
No, The attorney general “is a separately elected official in Colorado and makes independent prosecutorial decisions,” Jacobs said in an email. “The Governor does not make these choices.”		

How was Anadarko Petroleum Corp prosecuted for the Firestone accident?		
The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) today announced it has
approved the $18.25 million penalty against Kerr-McGee, a subsidiary of Occidental
Petroleum, at an Online Special Hearing. The Commission considered COGCC staff’s
Administrative Order by Consent (AOC), as a part of the enforcement process, and heard from
Kerr-McGee and Mrs. Erin Martinez, who lost her husband and brother when her home was

No, Hickenlooper’s successor, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis		

Did Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper accepted donations in exchange for not penalizing an oil and gas company involved in a fatal home explosion in 2017 ?		
A Hickenlooper campaign spokesperson told us the company had already contributed nearly $219,000 to Hickenlooper’s administration prior to the Firestone accident. In April 2020, under Hickenlooper’s successor, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, the COGCC approved a record $18.25 million fine — the largest ever issued by COGCC — against Kerr-McGee, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, which acquired Anadarko in August 2019. The company was fined for violating four rules, the COGCC said in its press release.But the NRSC pointed to an October 2019 Denver Post article that said some promises Colorado leaders made after the Firestone incident, such as providing a comprehensive, public map of all pipelines, hadn’t been fulfilled.
That may be, but there’s no evidence that contributions from Anadarko had anything to do with it. This claim is false.

Border Patrol agents apprehended about half as many migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal 2020 as they did the year before, according to newly released federal data. The sharp drop in the number of apprehended migrants follows a virtual shutdown of the border and new restrictions in the way asylum cases are handled in response to the coronavirus outbreak.

Following a dramatic rise in fiscal 2019, apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border fell by about half in fiscal 2020 as COVID-19 closed borders. There were 400,651 apprehensions in the 2020 fiscal year (October 2019-September 2020), a 53% decrease from the previous fiscal year, when apprehensions soared to their highest level in 12 years.

No, Such concerns led California to make the controversial decision in August 2018 to eliminate cash bail altogether, a move that the bail bond industry blocked pending a 2020 statewide referendum. In the new system, judges would detain defendants pretrial only if they are deemed dangerous or likely to skip court.

Are there states that don't have the authority to determine if someone is dangerous for pre-trial release?		
Thanks to a 1971 law, New York is the only state in the country where judges don’t have the authority to consider a person’s possible “dangerousness” in determining the conditions of their release before trial. When reform negotiations in the state began and the door was opened to modifying that system, some lawmakers wanted to add dangerousness as a sanctioned factor for pre-trial release, in exchange for the total abolition of bail in the state. Progressive reformers bristled—arguing that too often, judges ascribe dangerousness in ways that amplify the racial discrimination that pervades the justice system. Ultimately, they pursued a compromise that did not add dangerousness but preserved bail only for the most serious crimes.

Individual case counts were kept early during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak when the 2009 H1N1 virus first emerged. As the outbreak expanded and became more widespread, individual case counts become increasingly impractical and not representative of the true extent of the outbreak. This isbecause only a small proportion of persons with respiratory illness are actually tested and confirmed for influenza (including 2009 H1N1) so the true benefit of keeping track of these numbers is questionable. In addition, the extensive spread of 2009 H1N1 flu within the United States made it extremely resource-intensive for states to count individual cases. On July 24, 2009, CDC discontinued reporting of individual cases of 2009 H1N1, but continued to track hospitalizations and deaths.		

What was WHO's stance on H1N1 testing?		
For all of these reasons, WHO will no longer issue the global tables showing the numbers of confirmed cases for all countries. However, as part of continued efforts to document the global spread of the H1N1 pandemic, regular updates will be provided describing the situation in the newly affected countries. WHO will continue to request that these countries report the first confirmed cases and, as far as feasible, provide weekly aggregated case numbers and descriptive epidemiology of the early cases.

Yes, The Muslim Faith and the use of Alcohol Based Hand Sanitisers

Deb Group Ltd has sought advice on this matter from the Muslim Council of Britain
and the NHS, and has been given the following guidelines.

Muslims in the UK should not be concerned about using alcohol based sanitisers on
their skin because:

1. Any alcohol sold for use on the skin is rendered undrinkable, by law.

2. The issue of alcohol in the Muslim faith relates to the drinking of alcohol, and
not its use in other ways, such as the disinfection of skin.

3. Muslims are permitted to use alcohol based sanitisers for alleviating illness or
improving health.

4. The Muslim Food Board (UK) has confirmed that the use of alcohol based
sanitisers is permitted by their scholars.

5. For further reassurance, there is evidence to show that when using a sanitiser
the amount of alcohol absorbed through the skin is negligible.

404,"The national security law will only target an extremely small minority of people who have breached the law, while the life and property, basic rights and freedoms of the overwhelming majority of Hong Kong residents will be protected.","What is the law referred to in the claim?		
The Law of the People’s Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region		

When was this law enacted?		
30/06/2020		

When was this law first violated?		
01/07/2020
A man was arrested for holding a #HKIndependence flag in #CausewayBay, Hong Kong, violating the #NationalSecurityLaw.  This is the first arrest made since the law has come into force.		

How many arrests were made under this law on 01/07/2020?		
More than 300 people have been arrested in #HongKong so far for offences like unlawful assemblies, disorderly conduct in public places, furious driving, and breach of the #NationalSecurityLaw, which accounted for 9 arrests (5 males & 4 females).		

What measures can the HK Police take to implement the law?		
According to the rules, police may be authorized to conduct searches for evidence without a warrant in “exceptional circumstances.” Police may also apply for a warrant that requires a person suspected of violating the national security law to surrender their travel documents, thus restricting them from leaving Hong Kong.		

What measures can the HK Police take to implement the law?		
Additionally, under the rules, written notices or restraining orders may be issued to freeze or confiscate property if there are “reasonable grounds” to suspect that the property is related to an offense endangering national security.

Platforms and publishers, as well as internet service providers, may also be ordered to take down electronic messages published that are “likely to constitute an offence endangering national security or is likely to cause the occurrence of an offence endangering national security.”

Service providers who do not comply with such requests could face fines of up to 100,000 Hong Kong dollars ($12,903) and receive jail terms of six months.

Individuals who post such messages may also be asked to remove the message, or face similar fines and a jail term of one year.		

Did any western countries react to the passing of this law?		
The US Congress has approved a bill rebuking China over its crackdown in Hong Kong amid protests against a strict “national security” law that outlaws so-called subversive or terrorist acts, as well as collusion with foreign forces intervening in the city’s affairs		

Does the law contravene the right to freedom of speech?		
A Government spokesman made the following solemn statement today (July 2): The slogan ""Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times"" nowadays connotes ""Hong Kong independence"", or separating the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) from the People's Republic of China, altering the legal status of the HKSAR, or subverting the State power.

     The spokesman stated that the HKSAR Government strongly condemns any acts which challenge the sovereignty, unification and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of China. The Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region prohibits secession, subversion of state power and other acts and activities which endanger national security. The HKSAR Government calls upon members of the public not to defy the law.

414,"The next major advantage of the pandemic for the Deep State was the case made to the public for mail-in voting, a highly insecure practice proven to be rampant with fraud.","Is mail-in voting safe and secure?		
U.S. citizens will vote by mail this year in record numbers. In the face of a global health
emergency, election officials across the country from both parties are working heroically to ensure
that voting by mail is accurate, accessible, safe & secure.		

Is mail-in voting safe and secure?		
Voting by mail is a safe, secure way fror people to cast their ballot because states, especially those who have a long history of voting by mail, have established strong safeguards to prevent improper voting.		

What measures are taken to ensure mail-in voting does not lead to fraud?		
Current and former election officials in vote-by-mail states said their systems are designed specifically to mitigate these risks, starting with a regular stream of mail contact with voters to establish that the address listed for them on the rolls is accurate. The ERIC system, as well as regular checks against DMV, death and other records, flag voter registration entries that may need updating. Federal law also requires states to conduct basic list maintenance.

Once voting begins, the linchpin of the process is a ballot return envelope, which typically requires the voter’s signature and includes a unique bar code linked to that voter’s record. When the ballot is returned and the bar code is scanned, no other ballot can be cast by that voter for that election.

Election officials and security experts said certain measures are important for preventing fraud in mail voting, such as accurate voter rolls and a method of authenticating ballots such as signature matching. Such safeguards have been put in place over time in the five states that currently run universal mail elections: Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington.

The other mainstay of election security in vote-by-mail states is the signature verification process. Election workers are trained by law enforcement agencies to detect when a signature on the ballot envelope does not match signatures in a voter’s file. Discrepancies trigger a review that could end with a voter proving his or her identity — or being reported to law enforcement for possible ballot tampering.

All-mail states have implemented a range of other safeguards to ensure ballots are secure at all times, including dropboxes under 24-hour surveillance cameras, rules that two people be present with any ballot from the moment of receipt or collection, and detailed logs and reconciliation rules that require votes to be accounted for, down to the ballot.

Political scientists and foreign policy experts have used the term deep state for years to describe individuals and institutions who exercise power independent of—and sometimes over—civilian political leaders.		

Does a Deep State exist in America?		
Whether any of this means there is a deep state in America depends on your definition. Powerful bureaucrats with access to government secrets and trusted media friends certainly do try to influence presidents from the shadows. But in Washington, at least, their views and goals are not monolithic. And unlike their counterparts in the developing world, they do tend to execute the orders they’re given by the president, however grudgingly—and are committed to upholding the rule of law.		

Did the Democrats and the Deep state do anything to create the narcotics epidemic in the USA?		
They signed the 1994 Crime Bill which increased mass incarceration. They did not increase narcotic use to achieve this but instead became tougher on existing crime leading to more imprisonment.		

Who brings illegal drugs into the US?		
When people think of drug smugglers, they often imagine illegal immigrants sneaking into the United States across the southwest border. But the reality is that the vast majority of drug smuggling occurs at ports of entry (including airports), and the vast majority of traffickers are U.S. citizens.		

Who produces illegal drugs for the US market?

no facts or hard evidence to support such a bold assumption surrounding the initial source of the virus.		

Has the U.S. government funded the Wuhan lab?		
Yes, A U.S. NIH-funded $3.7 million project was approved by Trump's Covid-19 advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci in 2015,
after the Obama White House imposed a ban on 'monster-germ' research.		

Why did the U.S. government fund the Wuhan lab?		
In October 2014, the federal government declared a moratorium on gain-of-function research to weaponize viruses related to influenza, Middle
East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). As a result, the research was
outsourced to China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is currently at the center of scrutiny for the Covid-19
pandemic.		

Where did COVID-19 originate from?		
The novel coronavirus originated from the Hunan seafood market at Wuhan, China where bats, snakes, raccoon dogs, palm civets, and other animals are sold, and rapidly spread up to 109 countries.		

Where did COVID-19 originate from?		
The short answer is that we don’t know for sure yet. Scientists do agree that COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus from an animal (1,2). COVID-19 is a zoonosis, a human disease of animal origin. However, the animal source of SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the COVID-19 pandemic, has not yet been confirmed. It is likely to have its ancestral origins in a bat species (1,2) but it probably reached humans through an intermediary species (pangolins have been suggested) (3,4), or mutated within humans to be able to be transmitted between people and cause disease (3). This is a priority area for research but it is important to note that subsequent transmission of COVID-19 is from person to person. It is transmission between people that has spread the disease globally.		

When did the COVID-19 outbreak occur?		
In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread to other parts of China and overseas.1

Are PCR tests accurate in real world settings?		
In the real world, testing conditions and process are far from perfect, and accuracy suffers. Researchers still don’t know what the real-world false positive rate is, but clinical sensitivity of RT-PCR tests ranges from 66% to 80%. That means nearly one in three infected people who are tested will receive false negative results.		

Are PCR tests useful in the fight against Covid 19?		
Yes, Advantages of PCR Testing
 Valuable for detecting specific pathogens that are difficult to culture in vitro or require a
long cultivation period
 Significantly more rapid in providing results compared to culturing
o Enables earlier informed decision making
o Rapid diagnosis of bacteraemia, particularly for low levels of bacteria in specimens
 Useful in detecting cases in extra pulmonary specimens which may be missed by smear

On the request of Starmer, Alison Levitt, his then Principal Legal Adviser, released a report in 2013 on the 2009 decision not to prosecute Savile. It found that if prosecutors had taken a different approach then prosecution may indeed have been possible. Levitt found that Surrey Police did not tell the victims that other complaints had been made against Savile also, and that had they known this, victims would have been more likely to press charges.

The report also discovered a ‘lack of understanding’ by officers concerning the law and practice, concerning sexual offences. It was found that outdated regulations and training were partially to blame in the failure to prosecute Savile, indicating structural issues in the way officers were trained, rather than being a matter of personal responsibility.		

Was there blunders by the  police and lawyers during the prosecution of Jimmy Savile ?		
Britain’s chief prosecutor apologised for the failure to pursue four separate allegations against the BBC star, one made as recently as four years ago.

Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said there were failures by police in Sussex and Surrey and by the principal lawyer in dealing with the allegations. He issued a personal apology for the mistakes by the Crown Prosecution Service and announced a series of changes to improve the investigation of allegations by child victims.		

Did Keir Starmer helped Jimmy Savile to escape justice?		
In 2008 (a few months before Starmer became director of public prosecutions [DPP] at the CPS) Sussex Police launched an investigation into a possible sexual assault, but took no further action as the complainant did not wish to give evidence.  In 2009 the CPS reviewed four sexual assault claims against Savile and felt there was insufficient evidence with which to proceed - again, because none of Savile's accusers were prepared to support police action. Frankly, the CPS makes a lot of decisions like this and it would be strange for the director himself to make the decision personally - that's the responsibility of the reviewing lawyer. We may well question that decision, but asking whether there was in fact sufficient evidence is one thing; to assume that such evidence would have resulted in a conviction is quite another. Have any of us seen the evidence the CPS was presented with?  Have those spinning these accusations - or spreading them - actually spoken with any of those who brought the initial complaints against Savile? Starmer took over a CPS under fire on various fronts and, after 2011, especially on the Savile issue. While he had no personal involvement in the decision not to proceed, Starmer did commission a review, headed by Alison Levitt QC, in which he revealed failures at the heart of the CPS and in 2013 issued an apology. He acknowledged those failures, pledging to change the culture of the CPS and its internal mechanisms. A ""fundamental shift"" was required, he argued, as ""we cannot afford another Savile moment in five or ten years. While ""no improper motives"" were found, the Evening Standard reported that one of the review's major criticisms was that ""the CPS lawyer (my italics) should have challenged the police conclusions and sought to build a prosecution against Savile"". It also suggested the complainants should have been informed that there had been other complaints about Savile, as this would potentially have encouraged them to give evidence. This

They estimated that Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and India accounted for 57% of newborns with SCA in 2010, and that Nigeria and the DRC will probably still be the countries most in need of policies for the prevention and management of SCA in 2050.

You can apply to be Twitter verified and receive a blue checkmark badge next to your name. To become verified on Twitter, you simply update your profile with current information, verify a phone number and email address, then fill out a form requesting consideration as a verified user.

If you're applying for verification of a personal profile as opposed to a business profile, you'll also need a copy of a photo ID like a passport or driver's license.		

How do you spot a fake twitter account?		
Check the spelling and structure of the username: Fake Twitter accounts often use the real name, or something very similar, and the same photo as the genuine article, but the username is marginally different. 

Check the bio - what does it say?: Does it say spoof or parody or contain anything unusual that might set alarm bells ringing (see Felix Baumgartner, above)? According to Twitter’s terms of use, parody accounts are not discouraged but they are obliged to make this clear in the bio.  

Is the account verified?: Accounts with the official tick badge have been checked by Twitter and are who they purport to be.

Pleurisy is swelling (inflammation) of the thin layers of tissue (pleura) covering the lungs and the chest wall.		

What causes pleurisy?		
In young, healthy people, an infection of the lower respiratory system by a virus or bacteria may cause pleurisy. Pleurisy usually lasts a few days to 2 weeks. In very rare cases, the virus or bacteria may spread and cause pleurisy in others.

Other causes of pleurisy include air leaking into the pleural cavity from a hole in a lung (pneumothorax), injury to the chest (such as a broken rib), tuberculosis or other infections, or a tumor in the pleura.

Other conditions may also cause pleurisy. These include rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, sickle cell crisis, pulmonary embolism, or pancreatitis. Pleurisy may also develop as a complication of heart surgery.

497,Pregnant women are not more susceptible to COVID-19.,"What is this claim based on?		
Caring for Women Who Are Planning a Pregnancy, Pregnant, or Postpartum During the COVID-19 Pandemic		

What does the JAMA article say about pregnant women & Covid-19?		
Since its recognition in China in December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly spread throughout the world and become a pandemic. Although considerable data on COVID-19 are available, much remains to be learned about its effects on pregnant women and newborns.

No data are currently available to assess whether pregnant women are more susceptible to COVID-19. Pregnant women are at risk for severe disease associated with other respiratory illnesses (eg, 2009 H1N1 influenza),1 but thus far, pregnant women with COVID-19 do not appear to be at increased risk for severe disease compared with the general population		

What do the WHO guidelines say about the risks of Covid-19 for pregnant women?		
Pregnant women or recently pregnant women who are  older, overweight, and have pre-existing medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes seem to have an increased  risk of developing severe COVID-19
Due to changes in their bodies and immune systems, we know that pregnant women can be badly affected by some respiratory infections. It is therefore important that they take precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19, and report possible symptoms (including fever, cough or difficulty in breathing) to their healthcare provider.		

Are pregnant women at risk of serious illness due to COVID-19?		
Pregnant women might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19 illness. To reduce severe COVID-19–associated illness, pregnant women should be aware of their potential risk for severe COVID-19 illness. Prevention of COVID-19 should be emphasized for pregnant women and potential barriers to adherence to these measures need to be addressed.		

Are pregnant women at risk of serious illness due to COVID-19?		
The overall risk of COVID-19 to pregnant women is low. However, pregnant women who have COVID-19 appear more likely to develop respiratory complications requiring intensive care than women who aren't pregnant, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pregnant women are also more likely to be placed on a ventilator. In addition, pregnant women who are Black or Hispanic appear to be disproportionately affected by infection with the COVID-19 virus.

Risk factors for severe COVID-19 during pregnancy include older maternal age, a high body mass index and pre-existing diabetes or hypertension.		

Can COVID-19 be passed from mother to unborn child?		
We still do not know if a pregnant woman with COVID-19 can pass the virus to her fetus or baby during pregnancy or delivery. To date, the active virus has not been found in samples of fluid around the baby in the womb or breastmilk.

The British Government clinical trial tested six treatment options as part of its RECOVERY trial. One of these was dexamethosone.		

What did the government's RECOVERY trial find out about the effectiveness of dexamethosone as a COVID-19 treatment?		
Dexamethasone reduced deaths by one-third in ventilated patients (rate ratio 0.65 [95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.88]; p=0.0003) and by one fifth in other patients receiving oxygen only (0.80 [0.67 to 0.96]; p=0.0021). There was no benefit among those patients who did not require respiratory support (1.22 [0.86 to 1.75]; p=0.14).

Based on these results, 1 death would be prevented by treatment of around 8 ventilated patients or around 25 patients requiring oxygen alone.		

What have medical professionals said about the use of dexamethasone against the coronavirus?		
Department of Health on Wednesday advised the public to be cautious in interpreting the preliminary study findings that steroid drug dexamethasone can reduce the risk of the sickest patients dying from coronavirus disease.

DOH expressed concern that this discovery might lead people to ‘think it is a magic pill for COVID-19.’		

When was the claim made?		
17/06/2020		

Is there an FDA-approved cure for COVID-19 as of June 17, 2020?		
No, The health official reiterated that there is still no proven cure for and vaccine against COVID-19.		

What is dexamethasone used for?		
As an anti-inflammatory medication.  

Dexamethasone relieves inflammation in various parts of the body.  It is used specifically to decrease swelling (edema), associated with tumors of the spine and brain, and to treat eye inflammation.

To treat or prevent allergic reactions.

As treatment of certain kinds of autoimmune diseases, skin conditions, asthma and other lung conditions.

As treatment for a variety of cancers, such as leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma.  

To treat nausea and vomiting associated with some chemotherapy drugs.

Used to stimulate appetite in cancer patients with severe appetite problems. 

Also used to replace steroids in conditions of adrenal insufficiency (low production of needed steroids produced by the adrenal glands).		

Can dexamethasone be used to treat COVID-19?		
Dexamethasone is the first drug to be shown to improve survival in COVID-19. This is an extremely welcome result. The survival benefit is clear and large in those patients who are sick enough to require oxygen treatment, so dexamethasone should now become standard of care in these patients. Dexamethasone is inexpensive, on the shelf, and can be used immediately to save lives worldwide.		

Is dexamethasone a low-cost drug?		
Yes, Dexamethasone is a low-cost drug.

What is Juneteenth?		
The tradition started in 1866 in Texas and spread to nearby states.

The Civil Rights movement infused Juneteenth with new energy.

Today, 47 states recognize the day.		

What is Juneteenth?		
Juneteenth is a holiday commemorating the freedom of the slaves in the United States. The name Juneteenth is a combination of the words June and nineteenth. The day is also called Emancipation Day and Freedom Day.		

Where does Juneteenth stem from?		
Juneteenth is the oldest known celebration of African American freedom, marking the ending of slavery in the U.S. 
It commemorates the week in June 1865 that Major Gen. Gordon Granger led the Union soldiers to Galveston, Texas, declaring the war was over and the enslaved could go free. 
While President Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation officially freed slaves more than two years earlier, it was the surrender of General Lee in April 1865 and Granger’s arrival with the troops that created a force strong enough to overcome Texas’ resistance to the executive order to free slaves. 
The culmination of Granger’s trip led to his June 19 reading of the proclamation, coined as “Juneteenth” — the day the freed slaves and their families recounted memories, reassured each other of a newly-promised future and gathered in prayer.		

Do Americans know about Juneteenth?		
Today, if Americans have any knowledge at all about commemorations of the end of U.S. slavery, their reference point is generally Juneteenth.		

When did Juneteenth first become a state holiday?		
In 1980, Texas became the first state to recognize June 19 as a state holiday, which it did with legislation.		

Is Juneteenth recognized as a state holiday in other U.S. states?		
As of 2020, 48 states and the District of Columbia have passed legislation recognizing Juneteenth as a state holiday or as a day of observance.		

When did Juneteenth become prominent within U.S. states?		
The annual celebration began to spread throughout Texas and surrounding states. However, it became less popular in the early 1900's. It became popular once again in the 1950's and 1960's. In 1980 it became an official state holiday in Texas. There is currently a movement to get the day recognized on a national level.

514,An Expansion of Mail-in Ballots would increase the chance of theft in the USA.,"Who made this claim about the potential for theft of mail in ballots?		
Donald Trump		

Has Donald Trump voted by mail in ballot?		
Trump voted earlier this year, in a no-excuse absentee vote state -- meaning that a voter can request an absentee ballot (aka one you fill out at home and mail back to the election authority) without offering any excuse for why they want to do so.
Which is what Trump did. Being president is a more than full-time job, and he couldn't make time to travel to Florida to cast a vote in person. So he voted absentee.		

How secure is mail in voting (absentee ballot voteing)?		
Numerous safeguards are included in the absentee voting process. Absentee ballots are sent only to registered voters who request them using an official N.C. Absentee Ballot Request Form before the deadline. The request must be signed and include identifying information about the voter, including date of birth and driver’s license number or last four digits of the voter’s Social Security number. Voters must vote their ballot in the presence of two witnesses or a notary, and those witnesses must sign the absentee return envelope certifying that the voter marked their ballot and is the registered voter submitting the marked ballot.

Only the voter or their near relative or legal guardian may return the ballot. Upon return, the county board of elections reviews the absentee envelope to ensure compliance with the legal requirements. Once the ballot is accepted, that voter is marked in the system as having voted in that election.

Data on who has requested absentee ballots is now confidential until Election Day. Criminal penalties have been increased for absentee voting fraud-related offenses. Many people are watching our absentee voting process, including candidates, political parties, county boards of elections, and political and data scientists. If there are anomalies or questionable activities, they will be identified by or reported to election officials.

Finally, the State Board of Elections has an Investigations Division that investigates credible allegations of elections fraud and refers cases to prosecutors when warranted by the evidence. The State Board also conducts several post-election audits which will catch inconsistencies that can then be investigated by the board or the Investigations Division.		

What prevents someone from voting absentee and then voting again in-person?		
If someone has voted an absentee ballot and then shows up to vote in person, the check-in system will alert the poll worker that the person has already voted. Voting twice in the same election is a crime and is investigated by the State Board and referred to prosecutors when warranted by the evidence

515,Absentee voters in the USA have to go through a Very strict process.,"What are permissible reasons for absentee voting

You have a disability.

But it soon gained international recognition, after the death of Michael Brown in Missouri a year later.

No answer could be found.		

Are guns used during looting?		
Looters target gun stores to steal guns.		

What is the history behind 'when the looting starts, the shooting starts'?		
The “looting/shooting” phrase is traced back to Walter Headley, police chief of Miami from 1948 until his death in November 1968. In a press conference on Dec. 27, 1967, commenting on a new “get tough” policy he planned to institute to police the city’s black neighborhoods, Headley said: “We haven’t had any serious problems with civil uprising and looting because I’ve let the world filter down that when the looting starts, the shooting starts. These are my orders: Not three days after, but now. This is war. I meant it, every bit of it.”		

Did Donald Trump mean Walter Headley version of the saying 'When the looting starts, the shooting starts'?		
After backlash, President Donald Trump, clarified that “Looting leads to shooting, and that’s why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night. … I didn’t want this to happen, and that’s what the expression put out last night means.”		

Did Trump say that when the looting starts, the shooting starts and what are the two things it means ?		
Yes Trump did say that statement.
When the looting starts, the shooting starts, phrase means two things, 1) If there’s looting, there’s probably going to be shooting.
2) It should not be taken as a threat, that’s just a fact, because that’s what happens. 
An example to this incident is that in 1967 , the African American men took advantage of the civil rights campaign and did a series of robberies 
in the African american community of Liberty city. At that time the police chiefs picked up this statement where the looting starts, the shooting starts . 
This phrase aimed to instill fear in African Americans. Trump’s use of the slogan retains that power, Pauley said, ""while simultaneously communicating a tough, law-and-order ethos to his supporters.

What year did the first slave ships arrive in the American colonies?		
As early as 1526, enslaved Africans were part of a Spanish expedition to establish an outpost on the North American coast in present-day South Carolina		

Were any white slaves recorded as being sent to American colonies around 1619?		
No, between 1610 and 1619 no record of white children or white slaves being shipped to the American colonies appears in The Library of Congress records.		

What is the difference between slavery and servitude?		
The most common form of forced labor in the history of civilization is slavery. Servitude is the general term used to describe all types of forced labor. It is derived from the Latin noun servus, which really means “slave,” though it is recognizable as the source of “servant” as well. Throughout the ancient world, anyone who functioned as a servant was usually a slave.

In the kind of servitude called slavery, the laborer is considered property. He or she can be bought and sold like any other commodity. The origins of slavery are unknown, but it probably emerged as an economic necessity or convenience when people began to establish permanent communities based on agriculture.		

Were white workers in American colonies called slaves?		
No, White workers were not under slavery but indentured servitude. Indentured servitude was used as a form of contract labor in the British colonies of North America. Large numbers of German, English, and Scottish colonists arrived in North America as indentured servants. Some of them had been convicted criminals at home. The shortage of labor in the colonies occasionally led to people being kidnapped in Europe and transported to the Americas as indentured servants. The normal term of a contract was from four to seven years, after which the servant became free. This kind of contract was one means by which people too poor to come to the colonies were able to pay for their transportation. Contracts were often made with ship captains who, upon arrival in North America, sold the contracts to someone else.

Before the crisis hit, many Black and Latino workers held jobs done outside the home. Only 35.4 percent of Black adults and 25.2 percent of Latino adults reported they can do part of their work remotely, compared with 43.4 percent of white adults. Though reporting somewhat higher averages, these estimates largely correspond with earlier US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data on racial and ethnic differences in the ability to work from home.

Differences in who can telework could indicate who’s at higher risk of losing a job, hours, or income. But despite multiple sources showing Black and Latino adults are less able to work from home compared with white adults, families of nonelderly Black adults experienced only minimally higher rates of job loss.

Black workers in particular are disproportionately employed in many of the jobs considered “essential,” suggesting Black workers may experience less drastic job losses than would be expected.

Anticancer and Cancer Chemopreventive Potential of Grape Seed Extract and Other Grape-Based Products

Overall, completed studies from various scientific groups conclude that both grapes and grape-based products are excellent sources of various anticancer agents and their regular consumption should thus be beneficial to the general population.

Apart from the anticancer and chemopreventive efficacy of GSE against skin, colorectal, prostate, and breast cancers discussed above in detail, anticancer efficacy of this extract has also been observed against human lung cancer A427, A549, and H1299 cells, human gastric adenocarcinoma CRL-1739 cells, oral squamous cell carcinoma

What is laetrile?		
Laetrile is a man-made form of amygdalin, a plant substance found in some nuts, plants and seeds of fruit.		

Why do people with cancer use laetrile?		
Laetrile has been used as an anti cancer agent since the 1800’s. It is used either on its own or as part of a programme. This might include following a particular diet, high dose vitamin supplements and pancreatic enzymes.		

Is laetrile a proven cancer cure?		
Although, more recent studies have shown that laetrile can kill cancer cells in certain cancer types there is not enough reliable scientific evidence to show that laetrile or amygdalin can treat cancer. Despite this, it still gets promoted as an alternative cancer treatment.

There is not enough reliable evidence that it works.

A court case involving Clinton was in court, but she wasn’t on trial.		

Did the United States setup a House Committee to question Hillary Clinton over  2002 terror attack on Americans in Benghazi, Libya?		
Democratic presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spent 11 hours answering questions from the House Benghazi Committee Thursday. At one point, the hearing devolved into a yelling match between Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy and Democrats on the committee.

The bickering followed Gowdy's questions regarding Clinton's email correspondence with Sidney Blumenthal, a longtime Clinton family friend and informal adviser. Democrats on the committee suggested Gowdy's line of questioning was unfair and politically motivated.

""If you think we've heard about Sidney Blumenthal, wait for the next round!"" Gowdy declared before abruptly calling a recess in the middle of the marathon hearing.

Gowdy questioned why Clinton exchanged so many emails with Blumenthal pertaining to Libya, even though Blumenthal ""could not get hired by our government... had never been to Libya, [and] had no expertise with Libya.""

    What Hillary Clinton will say before the Benghazi panel

Gowdy suggested it was suspicious that Blumenthal, ""all the while working with the Clinton Foundation and some pseudo-news entities, had unfettered access to you."" By contrast, Gowdy said that Clinton's records showed ""not a single email to and from Ambassador [Chris] Stevens,"" the administration's trusted man on the ground in Libya and one of the four Americans killed in the September 11, 2012 attack on a U.S. facility in Benghazi.		

What did Hillary Clinton say about  the 2002 terror attack on Americans in Benghazi, Libya ?		
The moment Hillary Clinton seemed to realize that her testimony Thursday before the House Select Committee on Benghazi was not going to be a big problem for her or for her campaign came about forty-five minutes in. When the hearing opened, she had regarded the chairman, Trey Gowdy, of South Carolina, with irritated skepticism. She looked as if she might say something rash, if not throw something, and perhaps she might have. Nearly three years ago, in a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Benghazi, she lashed out after having been asked many times about U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice’s comments on the Sunday talk shows about what had instigated the attack, on September 11, 2012, in which four Americans, including Chris Stevens, the Ambassador to Libya, died. “What difference, at this point, does it make?” Clinton demanded. Out of context, she sounded unmoved by the men’s deaths. Now, in the House hearing, it seemed to dawn on her that the proper response to her Republican interrogators was not outrage but pity.

Peter Roskam, of Illinois, was laying out a scenario in which Clinton’s assumption of a leadership role on Libyan policy “didn’t come easy,” when he stopped and said, in case he might be overwhelming her, “I can pause while you’re reading your notes from your staff.” Clinton replied, “I can do more than one thing at a time, Congressman—thanks.” A minute or two later, Roskam said, “Go ahead and read the note if you need to.” This time, Clinton laughed. “I’m not done with my question,” Roskam said; he was just doing her a “courtesy.” “That’s all right,” Clinton responded, with a friendly wave of her hand. From then on, she was in control. “I’m sorry that doesn’t fit your narrative, Congressman. I can only tell you what the facts are,” she told Jim Jordan, of Ohio, who is the chairman of the Freedom Caucus. As he spoke, she rested her chin on the palm of one hand, as if he were not much more than a loud boor at a party who, puzzlingly, doesn’t seem to kn

Rather than protecting free speech, undermining Section 230 in this way will restrict more speech online. It will make it easier for the government itself to exert the levers of censorship, fundamentally undermining First Amendment rights in the United States.”		

Was the Trump's Executive Order a threat to future online speech ?		
ARTICLE 19 has condemned US President Donald Trump’s use of an Executive Order designed to force social media companies into moderating content as he sees fit. 

Executive Director Quinn McKew said:

“The use of an Executive Order to undermine key speech protections online threatens the internet as we know it.  

“For the President  to claim that he is doing this in the name of free speech is disingenuous at best.  Fact checking is not censorship, it is more speech. This is a clear attempt to push  companies into moderating content in line with the President’s interpretation of free speech, ahead of a divisive presidential election where social media will be a key campaigning battleground.”

The Executive Order seeks to undermine protections in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. This shields online intermediaries from liability for what their users say and protects intermediaries’ ability to moderate content on their  platforms. Intermediaries include Internet Service Providers and social media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Platforms also have their own free speech rights and their editorial functions are protected under the First Amendment.

McKew added: “Rather than protecting free speech, undermining Section 230 in this way will restrict more speech online. It will make it easier for the government itself to exert the levers of censorship, fundamentally undermining First Amendment rights in the United States.”

The row between Twitter and the President looks set to intensify after the social media platform marked tweets which threatened the use of force in the wake of civil unrest in Minneapolis as in violation of rules about glorifying violence. This is the first time Twitter uses such a label against a head of state and the US President in particular. In line with Twitter policy, the tweet was not removed as Twitter said it might be in the public interest but the public interest notice “limits the ability to engage with the Tweet		

Can Social media companies be sued under Trump's Executive Order ?		
The social media executive order makes it easier for companies like Twitter, Facebook and Google to be held liable for the content posted on their platforms, according to a draft obtained by ABC News.

“Much as he might wish otherwise, Donald Trump is not the president of Twitter,” said American Civil Liberties Union senior legislative counsel Kate Ruane after a draft of the executive order was made public earlier Thursday. ”This order, if issued, would be a blatant and unconstitutional threat to punish social media companies that displease the president.”

638,The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a domestic Terrorist Organization.,"Is there a current legal authority in the U.S. for designating a domestic organization as a terrorist organization?		
No, “No current legal authority exists for designating domestic organizations as terrorist organizations. Any attempt at such a designation would raise significant First Amendment concerns.”

@GeorgetownICAP’s Mary McCord		

Have concerns been raised about designating a domestic organization as a terrorist organization?		
Yes, ""designation of a domestic organization as a terrorist organization would raise serious concerns about infringing on First Amendment rights and cause legitimate fears that the designation tool could be used wrongly to target unpopular ideologies"". written by Mary B. McCord and Jason M. Blazakis , director of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies’ Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism.		

What is the Antifa Organization?		
Antifa is short for anti-fascists. The term is used to define a broad group of people whose political beliefs lean toward the left – often the far left – but do not conform with the Democratic Party platform. The group doesn’t have an official leader or headquarters, although groups in certain states hold regular meetings.

Antifa positions can be hard to define, but many members support oppressed populations and protest the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Some employ radical or militant tactics to get their message across.		

Does Trump have the authority to officially declare ANTIFA a domestic terrorist organisation?		
For one thing, antifa is not a discrete or centralized group, so it’s unclear how the government could give it a designation.

Beyond that, though, antifa is a domestic entity and, as such, not a candidate for inclusion on the State Department’s list of foreign terror organizations. Those groups, which include Islamic extremist organizations and the Real Irish Republican Army, are based overseas rather than in the U.S.

That designation matters for a variety of legal reasons, not least of which anyone in the United States who lends support to an organization on that list can face terrorism-related charges.

But “there is not a domestic equivalent,” said Joshua Geltzer, a former senior counterterrorism official in the Obama White House and founding executive director at the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at the Georgetown University Law Center.

There have been periodic calls, particularly after mass shootings by white supremacists, to establish a domestic terrorism law, but none has passed.

A well-fitting mask keeps the virus from reaching others. It can also protect the wearer from becoming infected. Also, masks stop people from touching their mouths and faces.		

Is there any benefit to wearing an ear loop face mask to help prevent catching or spreading covid 19?		
Yes while they might not prevent you from catching the virus they assist in stopping the spread by catching the majority of droplets.


From Source page:

""cloth masks are also effective at reducing the spread of these smaller particles""

""We can see directly that a piece of cloth blocks those droplets and the virus those droplets contain. People without symptoms who don’t even know they are sick are responsible for around half of the transmission of the virus.""

""This means that nearly any kind of simple cloth mask is great for source control. The mask creates humidity, this humidity prevents virus-containing droplets from turning into droplet nuclei, and this allows the fabric of the mask to block the droplets.""

642,Kenya's president said ' we have connected 99% of all schools to electricty',"Who electrifies schools in Kenya?		
This is a shared responsibility between the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation and state utility Kenya Power, according to energy ministry spokesperson Moses Nyandika.		

how many were electrified by 2016?		
Before 2013, the rural electrification agency focused on secondary schools, according to its 2016-2021 strategic plan. Some 6,530 of these had been electrified by June 2013, when Kenyatta’s administration started its first full financial year.
The agency then turned its focus to primary schools to support the new government’s digital learning plan. By June 2016 it had connected 8,259 secondary schools, and 22,648 of 23,401 public primary schools targeted, according to the strategic plan.		

How many were connected as of 2020?		
A spokesperson for the agency told Africa Check it has connected 22,927 public primary schools. This was 98.4% of the total number of public primary schools as of 2019.

The agency also told Africa Check some 8,755 public secondary schools, polytechnics and institutions of higher learning were connected as of 2020. But it did not break down this data further to allow us to calculate what percentage of secondary schools have been electrified.For early childhood development and education centres, some 204 have been provided with electricity, the agency said. This is less than 1%, or 0.7% specifically, of the 28,383 early childhood centres captured by the national statistics office for 2020.

The president’s figure would therefore have been accurate if he were referring only to public primary schools. Before his administration, some 6,530 secondary schools had already been connected, so he cannot take credit for them.

Available data also shows at least 99% of early childhood centres are not yet connected to electricity.

No. The figure would have been accurate if it is just referring to public primary schools and does not include Pre-primary and Secondary schools.

Yes, While the weather may be getting cooler, which makes wearing a mask a little more comfortable than in the heat, many still find masks can make them feel faint over prolonged periods. As Dr. Hideki Taniguchi, a dehydration specialist, told the Financial Times back in 2020: ""[Wearing a mask] stops cool air coming in, which raises the temperature especially above the neck; it retains humidity, so the throat becomes dry and people forget to drink.""		

What research is there to support the claim that wearing surgical face masks over a prolonged period of time can lead to feelings of weakness or similar side effects?		
Retired neurosurgeon Dr. Russell Blaylock has highlighted a number of studies linking prolonged mask use to headaches and lowered blood oxygen levels, which can weaken the immune system.
The side effects vary depending on whether they are cloth or paper surgical masks or N95 respirator masks because the N95, being a more effective filter, also limits breathing to a greater degree, and is therefore more commonly associated with headaches, Blaylock reported.
…A third study measured the blood oxygen of 53 surgeons using an oximeter before and after surgery.
""The researchers found that the mask reduced the blood oxygen levels (pa02) significantly. The longer the duration of wearing the mask, the greater the fall in blood oxygen levels,"" Blaylock wrote.
The potential for masks to reduce oxygen levels in the wearer are important not only because this can lead to passing out, but also because they have been linked to reduced natural immunity.		

What research is there to support the claim that wearing surgical face masks over a prolonged period of time can lead to feelings of weakness or similar side effects?

The potential for masks to reduce oxygen levels in the wearer are important not only because this can lead to passing out, but also because they have been linked to reduced natural immunity.		

Are there ways to prevent negative side effects such as feeling weak when wearing face masks?		
For those who aren’t medically exempt, but find wearing a mask uncomfortable, there are ways to make the experience feel more manageable:
- Opt for breathable materials
- Make sure it fits
- Carry extras if available
- Limit how long you wear one		

Are there ways to prevent negative side effects such as feeling weak when wearing face masks?		
As a second wave of COVID-19 is expected, and in preparation for future pandemics, it is imperative to identify solutions to manage these adverse effects. Frequent breaks, improved hydration and rest, skin care, and potentially newly designed comfortable masks are recommendations for future management of adverse effects related to prolonged mask use.		

Is it safe to wear a surgical face mask?		
For many years, health care providers have worn masks for extended periods of time with no adverse health reactions. The CDC recommends wearing cloth masks while in public, and this option is very breathable. There is no risk of hypoxia, which is lower oxygen levels, in healthy adults. Carbon dioxide will freely diffuse through your mask as you breathe.

If you feel uncomfortable in your mask, try to limit your talking and breathe through your nose. That will reduce the humidity level in your mask.

Produced without excluded methods, (e.g., genetic engineering, ionizing radiation, or sewage sludge). 

Produced using allowed substances. 

Overseen by a USDA National Organic Program-authorized certifying agent, following all USDA organic regulations.		

What is a food's nutrient content based on?

Does organic farming increase a food's nutrient content?		
If the growing conditions are the same, and soil composition equivalent, a tomato's nutrient content will be the same whether grown ""organically"" or conventionally		

Do lower levels of pesticides lead to better health?		
There is sufficient evidence to conclude that nonorganic food products contain higher levels of synthetic pesticides. However, a link between the consumption of an organic diet with health benefits is confounded by a number of lifestyle and demographic covariates. Therefore the health benefits from a decreased exposure to pesticides through organic food consumption remain unsubstantiated.

Aside from building healthy bones, vitamin D can boost the immune system by suppressing what’s called a cytokine storm — severe inflammation that occurs when the immune system becomes overactive and releases too many cytokine proteins.		

How might this help COVID-19?		
Backman said cytokine storms may contribute to COVID-19 deaths because the storms can damage people’s lungs. An April 17, 2020 article on WebMD also indicated that patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms had high levels of cytokines in their system.

The idea, then, is that vitamin D could suppress a catastrophic immune response and prevent people from developing severe COVID-19 symptoms that lead to death.		

Is the link between lower vitamin D levels and deaths from COVID-19 backed by research?		
Early studies into vitamin D suggests it may curb the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and reduce mortality rates. Further research is needed to examine the issue, and vitamin D is not a cure for the coronavirus.

Hegar, who is expected to provide his revised fiscal forecast in July, has already said that the current state budget will be billions of dollars out of balance.		

What was the main causes of imbalance in Texas' budget at the time of the claim?		
State sales tax collections declined as a result of efforts to stem the spread of COVID-19 through business closures, crowd limits and stay-at-home orders adopted in the state, as well as a precipitous drop in worldwide demand for oil,” Hegar said. “The steepest declines in tax remittances were from businesses most quickly and dramatically affected by social distancing: restaurants, performing arts venues, movie theaters, theme parks and fitness centers, as well as department stores and boutique retail shops. However, those losses were, to a degree, offset by increases from big-box retailers, grocery stores and online vendors. Remittances from oil- and gas-related sectors also fell significantly as oil and gas exploration and production companies slashed capital spending in response to the crash in oil price.

716,In 2019 some nurses starting their career got a pay rise of over 15%,"How much do newly qualified nurses earn?		
Salaries for most NHS staff are arranged into bands, and newly-qualified nurses start out in band 5 which starts at £24,907 in England. The more years of experience nurses accumulate, the higher their pay gets at band 5 level.

Between 2019/20 and 2020/21 nurses in band 5 would have seen their salary increase by between 3% and 12% through a combination of the amount you could earn at band 5 being increased, and their own progression through the band after gaining another year of experience.		

What is the upper limit of this progression?		
The upper limit of this, 12%, is calculated based on a nurse with five to six years’ experience in 2019/20 and earning £27,260, moving up to a salary of £30,615 in 2020/21, the salary for nurses in Band 5 with six to seven years’ experience in that year.		

Did any lower paid nurses see a salary increase in 15% over a year?		
No, no and the maximum 12% increase doesn't account for inflation. In real terms, the band 5 starting salary increased by 6.7% between 2017/18 and 2020/21. But since 2010/11, it has fallen by a total of 3.2%.

Increase in Retirement Age

For persons born in 1938 or later, their Social Security benefit may be affected by a provision that raises the age at which full Social Security benefits are payable.

The earliest a person can start receiving reduced Social Security retirement benefits will remain age 62.

Democrats do not believe that raising retirement age is a reasonable solution to the problem.

And then came COVID-19, which has totally disrupted people’s lives and required very different behavior. It is an unprecedented event that probably has never occurred in this combination. And it really endangers the survival of our civilization.""		

What has George Soros said about the opportunities created by Covid-19 pandemic?		
Soros did no mention opportunities in his interview but talked about the future of capitalism: ""We will not go back to where we were when the pandemic started. That is pretty certain. But that is the only thing that is certain. Everything else is up for grabs. I do not think anybody knows how capitalism will evolve.""

No answer could be found.		

Is mercury in the flu shot 2020?		
Thimerosal is a preservative used in multi-dose vials of the flu vaccine to keep them free from contamination and contains an organic form of mercury called ethyl mercury.

Ethyl mercury is not the same as methyl mercury, which may be found in fish and shellfish. Methyl mercury stays in the body and can make people sick, while thimerosal doesn't stay in the body. There is no evidence of harm caused by the low doses of thimerosal in vaccines.		

Is antifreeze in the flu shot 2020?		
The vaccine does not contain squalene, which has been accused – also without good evidence – of causing Gulf War syndrome.		

Is phenol in the 2020 flu shot?		
Phenol is used as a preservativeTrusted Source in at least four vaccines. It helps keep bacteria from growing in and contaminating the vaccine solutions.

Pneumovax 23 for conditions like pneumonia and meningitis
Typhim Vi for typhoid fever
ACAM2000 for smallpox
a phenol compound called 2-Phenoxyethanol is used in the vaccine Ipol, for polio		

Is animal blood in the 2020 flu shot?		
No answer could be found.		

Are animal viruses in the 2020 flu shot?		
Many flu vaccines are made by growing the viruses inside fertilized chicken eggs. This means that they contain a small amount of egg protein.

A newer version of the vaccine, called Flucelvax, is grown in animal cells instead.		

Is Formaldehyde in the 2020 flu shot?		
Vaccine skeptics point to inactive ingredients used in some versions of flu vaccines. Thimerosal is used as a preservative and formaldehyde is used in killing the live virus to make it inactivated, as noted above. Repeated studies have shown that these substances are not harmful in the tiny amounts contained in flu vaccines.

What was Joe Biden's May 4th Speech about?		
Protecting essential workers		

How does Joe Biden suggest protection of essential workers safety during election season in the United States?		
Biden expressed continued support for in-person voting during the crisis. “A convention, having tens of thousands of people in one arena, is very different than having people walk into a polling booth with accurate spacing with 6-10 feet apart, one at a time going in, and having the machines scrubbed down,” Biden said last Thursday. “I think you could hold the election as well, dealing with mail-in ballots and same day registration. I mean, there’s a lot of things that can be done—that’s for the Wisconsin courts and folks to decide.”		

How does Joe Biden suggest making the voting process easier during lockdown?		
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is calling on Congress to provide enough money for every state to allow voters to cast a ballot by mail this November amid the coronavirus pandemic.

In making that pitch during an online fundraiser Thursday night, Biden blasted President Donald Trump for working to block emergency funding for the cash-strapped U.S. Postal Service, which would handle tens of millions of ballots this fall. Biden said it’s evidence that Trump already is trying to “undermine” the election and make it more difficult for Americans to vote.

“We have to make it easier for everybody to be able to vote, particularly if we are still basically in the kind of lockdown circumstances we are in now,” Biden told about 650 donors. “But that takes a lot of money, and it’s going to require us to provide money for states and insist they provide mail-in ballots.”

It’s perhaps Biden's most explicit call for a national mail election since COVID-19 upended the 2020 campaign and every aspect of American life. The former vice president doesn’t propose eliminating in-person voting. But he said state and local officials must do more to make polling locations conform to public health protocols, while steering voters toward other options.

The EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Service (HHS) declaration that circumstances exist
to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Veklury has not undergone the same type of review as an FDA-approved or cleared product. FDA may issue an
EUA when certain criteria are met, which includes that there are no adequate, approved, available alternatives.
In addition, the FDA decision is based on the totality of scientific evidence available showing that it is
reasonable to believe that the product meets certain criteria for safety, performance, and labeling and may be
effective in treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. All of these criteria must be met to allow for
the product to be used in the treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

the conclusion was that in general increased physical activity leads to more oxygen demand at our tissue level; hence, there could be a less efficient exchange of airflow. But the severity of this also differed from the wearing of face masks.		

Are there any other studies?		
Yes, another fascinating study among surgeons who routinely wear the ‘surgical mask’ for operations, there was an increase in heart rates and a decrease in oxygen saturation of their blood, after one hour of putting on this type of mask. But the researchers reported these findings as not being conclusive,

What are the Fulani Herdsmen killings?		
Fulani herds have gradually been pushed southward toward Nigeria’s “Middle Belt,” a handful of states straddling the pre-colonial line dividing Nigeria’s predominantly Muslim north from its Christian south. The Middle Belt is a farming region, and the advancing Fulani-owned herds have increasingly encroached on croplands.

The resulting conflicts over land have taken on an ethnic and religious character, as many of the farmers of Nigeria’s Middle Belt are ethnic Berom, an indigenous people who are predominantly Christian.

There have been studies that have revealed that men are more likely to get more severe symptoms from COVID-19 disease and also more likely to die from complications of the disease. A new study corroborates these findings. The study titled, “Gender differences in patients with COVID-19: Focus on severity and mortality,” is published in the latest issue of the journal Frontiers in Public Health.

What did the study find?

The study reveals that both men and women are equally at risk of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2, and men are more at risk of suffering the severe effects of COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 and also more at risk of dying of the infection. Older men with underlying diseases are more at risk because of their age, as well as their gender, say the researchers. They wrote, “Older age and a high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and SARS.”		

Are men more likely to die than women from COVID-19?		
In Italy and China deaths of men are more than double those of women. In New York city men constitute about 61% of patients who die. Australia is shaping up to have similar results, though here it’s mostly in the 70-79 and 80-89 age groups.		

Why are men more likely to die than women?		
One major variable in severity of COVID-19 is age. But this can’t explain the sex bias seen globally because the increased male fatality rate is the same in each age group from 30 to 90+. Women also live on average six years longer than men, so there are more elderly women than men in the vulnerable population.

The other major factor is the presence of chronic diseases, particularly heart disease, diabetes and cancer. These are all more common in men than women, which might account for some of the bias.

815,Over 100 nurses in Rajasthan’s Jhalawar (India) resigned because of misconduct by members of the Tablighi Jamaat (non-political organisation) and claim that they were spitting on them.,"What is Tablighi Jamaat ?		
Tablighi Jamaat, which means 'the Society for Spreading Faith', is an Islamic missionary movement which aims to encourage Muslims to return to practising their religion during the lifetime of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and particularly in matters of ritual, dress, and personal behavior. The teachings of Tabligh Jamaat are expressed in ""Six Principles"" - Kalimah (Declaration of faith), Salah (Prayer), Ilm-o-zikr (Knowledge), Ikraam-e-Muslim (Respect of Muslim), Ikhlas-e-Niyyat (Sincerity of intention), Dawat-o-Tableegh (Proselytizaton).		

Who founded The Tablighi ?		
The Tablighi Jama’at was founded in 1926 in Mewat, India, by Maulana Muhammad Ilyas, an Islamic scholar and teacher. The movement began as an effort to counteract the activities of Hindu revivalists in India, who at the time were attempting to convert Muslims to Hinduism. Worried that existing Islamic educational institutions were not capable of fending off the Hindu challenge, Ilyas envisioned a movement that would send missionaries to villages to instill Muslims with core Islamic values.		

Why did the nurses resign from Jhalawar hospital?		
the reports mentioned that the nurses had resigned due to administration issues and to rebel against low wages. The nurses also mentioned in their resignation letter that the healthcare workers weren't being given proper protection gear or PPE kits; they also mentioned how they were willing to come back to work if the conditions improved and if PPE kits were provided.

816,Australia's COVIDsafe app traces and monitors the location of a user.,"Can COVIDsafe app traces and monitors the location of a user ?		
The federal government has announced plans to introduce a contact tracing mobile app to help curb COVID-19’s spread in Australia. However, rather than collecting location data directly from mobile operators, the proposed TraceTogether app will use Bluetooth technology to sense whether users who have voluntarily opted-in have come within nine metres of one another.

Contact tracing apps generally store 14-21 days of interaction data between participating devices to help monitor the spread of a disease. The tracking is usually done by government agencies. This form of health surveillance could help the Australian government respond to the coronavirus crisis by proactively placing confirmed and suspected cases in quarantine.		

Does  COVIDsafe app use Bluetooth tracking  technology ?		
In a scramble to track, and thereby stem the flow of, new cases of the Coronavirus, Governments around the world are rushing to track the locations of their populace. One way to do this is to write a smartphone app which uses Bluetooth technology, and encourage (or mandate) that individuals download and use the app. The aim of this piece is to provide more detail on the technology itself, rather than a deep dive into the risks and whether or not Bluetooth technology should be used.		

Can COVIDsafe app traces and monitors the location of the users ?		
The COVIDsafe app doesn’t have any geolocation capability, it does not track your location, only the proximity of your phone to other people’s phones that have downloaded the app and cannot monitor a person’s location at any time.Experts at the University of Sydney have also stated the app cannot track location.

There is a meme circulating on Facebook that seems to be based on the conspiracy theory that Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy were assassinated by the Rothschilds because they wanted to “end the federal reserve banking system.” Let’s pick this meme apart to see how historically accurate it is.

1. There was no federal reserve system when Lincoln was president. The Federal Reserve System was not established until 1913.

2. Prior to the Federal Reserve System, there had been a national bank*, and Andrew Jackson had made its end one of his key second-term goals.

3. Two assassins attempted to kill Jackson, but no evidence suggests that they were sent by the Bank.**

4. Some people have emphasized the eerie similarities between Lincoln and Kennedy, which are easily explainable.

* There were two national banks, in fact: The 1st Bank of the U.S., which was chartered from 1791-1811 and the 2nd Bank of the U.S., chartered from 1816-1836.

848,Convalescent plasma therapy showing promise against COVID-19,"What is Convalescent plasma therapy?		
Using convalescent plasma -- a component of blood -- as a treatment is a decades-old idea, and has been used to treat other diseases like influenza and measles. When a patient recovers from a disease, they produce antibodies to fight the presence of the antigen that caused the disease, and those proteins will remain in the blood for a few months.		

What proof is there that Convalescent plasma therapy is working for coronavirus patients?		
Results  All 5 patients (age range, 36-65 years; 2 women) were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of treatment and all had received antiviral agents and methylprednisolone. Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalized within 3 days in 4 of 5 patients, the SOFA score decreased, and Pao2/Fio2 increased within 12 days (range, 172-276 before and 284-366 after). Viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion, and SARS-CoV-2–specific ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers increased following the transfusion (range, 40-60 before and 80-320 on day 7). ARDS resolved in 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. Of the 5 patients, 3 have been discharged from the hospital (length of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days), and 2 are in stable condition at 37 days after transfusion.

Conclusions and Relevance  In this preliminary uncontrolled case series of 5 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was followed by improvement in their clinical status. The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment, and these observations require evaluation in clinical trials.		

What proof is there that Convalescent plasma therapy is working for coronavirus patients?		
COVID-19 is currently a big threat to global health. However, no specific antiviral agents are available for its treatment. In this work, we explored the feasibility of convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion to rescue severe patients. The results from 10 severe adult cases showed that one dose (200 mL) of CP was welltolerated and could significantly increase or maintain the neutralizing antibodies at a high level, leading to disappearance of viremia in 7 days. Meanwhile, clinical symptoms and paraclinical criteria rapidly improved within 3 days. Radiological examination showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 days. These results indicate that CP can serve as a promising rescue option for severe COVID-19 while the randomized trial is warranted.		

What proof is there that Convalescent plasma therapy is working for coronavirus patients?		
In order to evaluate the efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in the treatment of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 80 SARS patients were given convalescent plasma at Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, between 20 March and 26 May 2003. Good outcome was defined as discharge by day 22 following the onset of SARS symptoms. Poor outcome was defined as death or hospitalization beyond 22 days. A higher day-22 discharge rate was observed among patients who were given convalescent plasma before day 14 of illness (58.3% vs 15.6%; P<0.001) and among those who were PCR positive and seronegative for coronavirus at the time of plasma infusion (66.7% vs 20%; P=0.001).

853,Drinking milk with honey on an empty stomach is the antidote to COVID-19.,"What is the role of diet and nutrition during the COVID-19 pandemic?		
nutrition is intricately linked to immunity and to the risk and severity of infections. Poorly nourished individuals are at a greater risk of various bacterial, viral, and other infections. 
Conversely, chronic or severe infections lead to nutritional disorders or worsen the nutritional status of affected people. Therefore, it is imperative for all of us to pay attention to our diet and nutritional status during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.		

What recommendations are given?		
Indeed, consuming good quality diets is always desirable, and this is particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic. A healthy diet, as depicted by the Healthy Eating Plate, emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts, moderate consumption of fish, dairy foods, and poultry, and limited intake of red and processed meat, refined carbohydrates, and sugar. Added fats should be primarily liquid oils such as olive, canola, or soybean oil.

855,Drinking ash of Phyllostachys nigra (black bamboo) mixed with honey and cow’s milk is a potent treatment for COVID-19.,"Is black bamboo used in alternative medicine?		
Yes, 2.1.2 Phyllostachys nigra (Lodd.) Munro Commonly known as “black bamboo”, this is another major species in the genus Phyllostachys. Flavonoids extracted from black bamboo leaves have potent antioxidant activities (Hu et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2002). Among these flavonoids, flavone c-glucosides and p-coumaric acid reportedly have long retention time in the colon and may contribute to free radical scavenging (Zhang et al., 2007). Luteolin 6-C-(6″-O-trans-caffeoylglucoside), an antioxidant isolated from the leaves, has been reported to protect against oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity in retinal ganglion cells (Lee et al., 2010). It also enhances the activity of aldose reductase and inhibits the formation of advanced glycation end products, and therefore may potentially have a role in the prevention of diabetic complications (Jung et al., 2007).
Orientin, another antioxidant obtained from the leaves of black bamboo, exerts vaso-relaxant activity through the inhibition of intracellular Ca2+ release and extracellular Ca2+ influx (Fu et al., 2005). Orientin also prevents apoptosis induced by hypoxia and reoxygenation in myocardium and cardiomyocytes. The mechanism for this effect is inhibition of the activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (Fu et al., 2006). These studies suggest potential for cardio-protective effects.

The acetone fraction of the leaves of Phyllostachys nigra (Lodd.) Munro has been shown to enhance leukemia cell differentiation (Kim et al., 2007b), and inhibit interleukin-12 (IL-12) production in lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages via decreasing NF-kappaB binding activity (Kim et al., 2007a). These preliminary findings suggest potential anti-leukemia and anti-inflammation effects of the acetone extract.

2018-2019 Estimates

Influenza activity in the United States during the 2018–2019 season began to increase in November and remained at high levels for several weeks during January–February5. Influenza A viruses were the predominant circulating viruses last year. While influenza A(H1N1pdm09) viruses predominated from October 2018 – mid February 2019, influenza A(H3N2) viruses were more commonly reported starting in late February 2019. Influenza B viruses were not commonly reported among circulating viruses during the 2018–2019 season. The season had moderate severity based on levels of outpatient influenza-like illness, hospitalizations rates, and proportions of pneumonia and influenza-associated deaths.

CDC estimates that the burden of illness during the 2018–2019 season included an estimated 35.5 million people getting sick with influenza, 16.5 million people going to a health care provider for their illness, 490,600 hospitalizations, and 34,200 deaths from influenza (Table 1). The number of influenza-associated illnesses that occurred last season was similar to the estimated number of influenza-associated illnesses during the 2012–2013 influenza season when an estimated 34 million people had symptomatic influenza illness6.

Peak activity during the 2018–2019 influenza season was classified as having moderate severity across ages in the population. Compared with the 2017–2018 season , which was classified as high severity, the overall rates and burden of influenza were much lower during the 2018–2019 season (Table 2). Among children, however, rates of influenza during the 2018–2019 season were similar to the 2017–2018 season. In addition, the 2018–2019 season had two waves of activity, including a wave predominated by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses and another wave of similar magnitude attributable to influenza A(H3N2) viruses5. The dual waves resulted in a protracted season during 2018–2019 that was less severe when compared with peak activity in 2017–2018, but r		

How many people got infected with the seasonal flu in 2018-2019 in the United States ?		
The overall burden of influenza (flu) for the 2018-2019 season was an estimated 29 million flu illnesses, 13 million flu-related medical visits, 380,000 flu-related hospitalizations, and 28,000 flu deaths (Table 1).

For the past several years, CDC has estimated the numbers of flu illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths1–4. More information on How CDC Estimates Flu Burden and Why CDC Estimates Flu Burden is available.

Any vaccine can cause side effects. For the most part these are minor (for example, a sore arm or low-grade fever) and go away within a few days. 

Remember, vaccines are continually monitored for safety, and like any medication, vaccines can cause side effects.

As might be expected in Canada, vaccination policies are as diverse as the geogra-high immunization rates by educating their populations about the benefits of vaccines. Just three have legislated vaccination policies, applying strictly to children about to enrol in school. Ontario and New Brunswick require immunization for diphtheria, tetanus, polio, measles, mumps, and rubella immunization, while Manitoba requires a measles vaccination.

In each case, though, the legislation includes an exemption clause. Essentially, each of the three provinces allows parents to request that their child be exempted from the vaccination requirement on medical or religious grounds, or simply out of conscience. In such instances, in the event of a disease outbreak, unvaccinated children can be excluded from entering a school.

Kissler is a co-author of a paper that stated that ""prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022."" He said he is hesitant to link the increase solely to lifting social distancing measures, because there are a lot of reasons cases could rise after a period of sustained low transmission.

The claim asserts that because alcohol is used in hand sanitizer and cleaning products to kill the virus that causes COVID-19 on hands and surfaces, drinking it will have the same effect inside the body and sanitize the throat. This is definitely not the case. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that, while certain types of alcohol can be used to disinfect surfaces and your skin, they are poisonous when ingested. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers require an alcohol concentration of 60% to 80% by volume		

Will drinking alcohol disinfect your throat or kill COVID-19 in your body?		
No, Drinking alcohol actually increased health risks when one is infected with COVID and increases susceptibility to catching COVID and other illnesses.

Does Trump have the authority to override stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders from governors, or “total” authority in general?		
No, “The President has no formal legal authority to categorically override local or state shelter-in-place orders or to reopen schools and small businesses,” Stephen I.

This plan will build on the successes of current work to achieve key milestones in the discovery, development and delivery of lifesaving vaccines to the most vulnerable populations in the poorest countries over the next decade.

The collaboration follows the January 2010 call by Bill and Melinda Gates for the next ten years to be the Decade of Vaccines.  The Global Vaccine Action Plan will enable greater coordination across all stakeholder groups – national governments, multilateral organizations, civil society, the private sector and philanthropic organizations -- and will identify critical policy, resource, and other gaps that must be addressed to realize the life-saving potential of vaccines. 

The structure of the Decade of Vaccines Collaboration includes a Leadership Council to provide oversight for the planning effort, a Steering Committee that holds the primary responsibility for developing the action plan, an International Advisory Committee to assist the Leadership Council in evaluating the action plan, and a Secretariat for administrative support. 

Prof. Pedro Alonso, Director for the Institute for Global Health of Barcelona and Dr. Christopher Elias, President and CEO of PATH, have been appointed co-chairs of the Steering Committee and the Secretariat.

What are the potential health risks from 5G?		
To date, and after much research performed, no adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies. Health-related conclusions are drawn from studies performed across the entire radio spectrum but, so far, only a few studies have been carried out at the frequencies to be used by 5G.

Tissue heating is the main mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency fields and the human body. Radiofrequency exposure levels from current technologies result in negligible temperature rise in the human body.

As the frequency increases, there is less penetration into the body tissues and absorption of the energy becomes more confined to the surface of the body (skin and eye). Provided that the overall exposure remains below international guidelines, no consequences for public health are anticipated.

927,The state of California admitted in a court settlement that a million people voted improperly in the US elections in 2019.,"What happens to an inactive voter?		
a State may remove a registrant who ""(i) has failed to
respond to a notice"" and ""(ii) has not voted or appeared to vote ...
during the period beginning on the date of the notice and ending on
the day after the date of the second general election for Federal office
that occurs after the date of the notice"" (about four years). 52 U. S. C.
§20507(d)(l)(B). Not only are States allowed to remove registrants
who satisfy these requirements, but federal law makes this removal
mandatory.		

What is the US Federal law regarding inactive voters?		
The National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) is a federal law requiring the removal of inactive registrations from the voter rolls after two general federal elections (encompassing from 2 to 4 years).		

What are the main reasons that voters become inactive?		
Inactive voter registrations belong, for the most part, to voters who have moved to another county or state or have passed away.		

What was the situation regarding registered voters in the County of Los Angeles  in January 2019?		
Los Angeles County had the highest number of inactive registrations of any single county in the US, with more voter registrations on its voter rolls than it had citizens old enough to register. This means that more than one out of every five LA County registrations likely belongs to a voter who has moved or is deceased.		

What was the situation regarding registered voters in the County of Los Angeles  in January 2019?		
Los Angeles County had on its rolls more than 1.5 million potentially ineligible voters.		

What was the federal lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch against California in the 2019 US elections about?		
In its lawsuit, Judicial Watch alleged:

Los Angeles County has more voter registrations on its voter rolls than it has citizens who are old enough to register.  Specifically, according to data provided to and published by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, Los Angeles County has a registration rate of 112 percent of its adult citizen population.

The entire State of California has a registration rate of about 101 percent of its age-eligible citizenry.

Eleven of California’s 58 counties have registration rates exceeding 100 percent of the age-eligible citizenry.		

What did the federal lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch against California in the 2019 US elections confirm?		
The lawsuit confirmed that Los Angeles County has on its rolls more than 1.5 million potentially ineligible voters. This means that more than one out of every five LA County registrations likely belongs to a voter who has moved or is deceased. Judicial Watch notes that “Los Angeles County has the highest number of inactive registrations of any single county in the country.”

The Judicial Watch lawsuit also uncovered that neither the State of California nor Los Angeles County had been removing inactive voters from the voter registration rolls for the past 20 years. The Supreme Court affirmed last year in Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Inst., 138 S. Ct. 1833 (2018) that the NVRA “makes this removal mandatory.”		

Do inactive voter registrations count as a vote?		
No, These voters do not automatically receive a mail ballot in each election. They are still eligible to vote by visiting a Voter Service and Polling Center during election time, or they can contact the Elections Division to find out more information about how to reactivate their record.		

Do inactive voter registrations count as a vote?		
No, Your inactive status will revert to active status, if you update your voter registration record, go to the polls to vote, or request an absentee ballot. However, if you do not take any of these actions after two general (federal) elections from the date you were first made inactive, your name will be removed from the registration system. You will have to re-register again in order to vote.

Prevention Strategies in Alignment With the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Behavior

Wear a Mask: When in public settings or when around people outside of your household, wear a properly-fitting cloth face covering. Wash your hands before putting on your face covering, put it over your nose and mouth and secure it under your chin, and try to fit it snugly against the sides of your face. Make sure you can still breathe easily.

Hand washing: The most well-established way to prevent respiratory infections such as influenza and coronavirus is frequent and thorough hand washing with soap and water. Scrub your hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

Hand sanitizer: Handwashing with soap and water is the best way to reduce germs, but if they are not available, alcohol-based hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol can help to reduce the spread of infection. Note: avoid any products containing triclosan, a known hormone-disrupting chemical.

Covering your mouth and nose: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing; if your hands are not free or you don’t have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your sleeve, not your bare hands.

Not touching your face: Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, which can help provide the virus with a route of entry into the body. Since the average individual touches their face an average of 15 times per hour, remain vigilant!

Keeping surfaces clean: Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces, especially when someone is ill. Surfaces to consider include doorknobs, phones, computer keyboards, remotes, and other surfaces that are frequently touched in rooms such as the bathroom and kitchen.
Lifestyle

Stress reduction: Chronic stress can negatively alter immune system responses, making you more likely to get sick. Identify your personal stress reduction strategies and practice them regularly.

Sleep: Sleep has a big influence on immune function, so it is es		

How does burning candles eliminate corona		
COVID-19 can be transmitted by people with the virus coughing or sneezing, releasing tiny contaminated droplets into the air, putting anyone within range in danger of inhaling them. These droplets can travel more than a metre from the infected person, allowing them to settle on any surfaces ready to be transferred to anyone that touches the surface.

The virus can live on some surfaces for several days. Data from the 2003 SARS outbreak, which was a similar illness to the latest coronavirus, showed the virus could contaminate plastered walls for up to a day and a half, plastic and stainless steel for 72 hours, and glass for 96 hours. So it’s likely the mobile phone, tablet or computer screen you are reading this on could harbour COVID-19 for up to four days, and be transferred to anyone touching the screen.

Adopting good hygiene is one of the most effective weapons to slow or prevent the virus spreading. Here are six things you can do to protect yourself and others.


1. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth

Our hands touch door handles, keyboards, taps and numerous other surfaces, so the virus could easily be picked up this way. Rubbing tired eyes or touching your nose or mouth could transfer the virus from your hands into your body.

2. Wash your hands regularly

Clean your hands thoroughly and often, using plenty of soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub to kill any virus on your hands. Scrub for at least 20 seconds, making sure you clean fingers, thumbs and palms.



3. Practise respiratory hygiene


If you cough or sneeze, use a tissue and throw it in the trash afterwards. If you don’t have a tissue, cough into the crook of your arm instead of using your hand. If possible, avoid coughing or sneezing near other people.

4. Maintain social distancing

Be aware of people around you and keep your distance from anyone coughing or sneezing. Stay at least 1 metre away to prevent inhaling the small liquid droplets sprayed by coughs and sneezes.

958,Prince Charles was cured of Covid by Ayurveda medicine.,"What is Ayurveda?		
Ayurveda, a natural system of medicine, originated in India more than 3,000 years ago. The term Ayurveda is derived from the Sanskrit words ayur (life) and veda (science or knowledge). Thus, Ayurveda translates to knowledge of life. Based on the idea that disease is due to an imbalance or stress in a person's consciousness, Ayurveda encourages certain lifestyle interventions and natural therapies to regain a balance between the body, mind, spirit, and the environment.

Ayurveda treatment starts with an internal purification process, followed by a special diet, herbal remedies, massage therapy, yoga, and meditation.		

How did Prince Charles' office respond to this claim?		
A day after Union Minister of State for AYUSH Shripad Naik claimed that ayurvedic treatment helped UK’s Prince Charles to be cured of coronavirus, the Prince’s spokesperson on Friday rejected the claim and said that he had “followed the medical advice of the NHS in the UK”.

963,"Alcohol weakens the immune system, making it difficult for the body to fight infections such as Covid-19.","Does Alcohol intake weakens the immune system ?		
Too much alcohol dulls more than your wits. It also weakens your immune system and could make you much more vulnerable to viruses, including HIV.

To see how alcohol affects resistance to infection, Gyongyi Szabo of the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester and colleagues exposed monocytes – white blood cells involved in the front-line defence against infection – to chemicals that mimic viruses and bacteria. Half of the cells were also soused in the levels of alcohol that a person might have in their blood after quaffing four or five alcoholic drinks daily for a week.

Alcohol blunted the monocytes’ defences. When the over-the-limit cells were exposed to a virus mimic, they produced only a quarter as much of the virus-fighting signalling molecule called type-1 interferon as teetotal monocytes made.

“Interferon is pivotal, the first response to any viral infection,” says Szabo. “There’s no viral elimination without it.”		

What is the effect of Alcohol  on the immune system ?		
Weakening the immune system is one of many negative effects heavy alcohol consumption has on the body. The mechanism is not fully understood and other factors such as age, gender, diet, state of general health may play a part.

Some studies have shown that, in moderation, certain alcoholic beverages such as wine and beer can actually decrease inflammation in the body. But at the same time, other studies suggest that even moderate consumption can do damage.		

How does Alcohol impact the Immune System ?		
Advanced knowledge into the complex multi-layered interactions of alcohol on the immune system has been exposed in a wide range of research papers over the past decade, concluding that excessive alcohol consumption and misuse can have serious long-term deleterious effects on the immune system. Additionally, a mother who exposes her developing fetus to alcohol puts the baby at risk for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and an impaired immune system that is more susceptible to disease. An adult who drinks to excess puts themselves at risk of contracting pneumonia, as well as a greater likelihood of acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, alcoholic liver disease (ALD), and slower recovery from infection, wound healing and trauma.

We show that various phytochemicals of Artemisia herba-alba can be useful against COVID-19 (in silico)...there is no sufficient clinical research evidence based on these compounds for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, after the validation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in in vitro and in vivo research models, these potential bioactive phyto-compounds can prove to be an alternative therapeutic option for SARS-CoV-2 treatment. To conclude, this study connects how the ethnic usages of a given medicinal plant coupled with pharmacological activity reports and the in silico screening of its phytochemicals can lead to the better management of COVID-19, which is extremely important for dealing with COVID-19 and its associated comorbidities.

Was there huge interest from British people, in these jobs?		
job site Totaljobs reported at the start of April that there had been an 83% increase in applications for agricultural roles in the past month		

Was there still a shortage of workers despite this?		
The Country Land and Business association estimates that 80,000 agricultural workers will be needed by the industry this season. Others report a shortage closer to 90,000, although it is unclear where this figure comes from.

The Guardian reported in mid-April that 450 Romanian workers were expected to be brought in to help by one charter airline. This would still leave the vast majority of roles needing to be filled. 

The same article quotes Concordia, a Brighton-based charity that recruits volunteers, as saying that despite high interest in paid roles, of the 35,000 applicants, only 5,500 had taken up interview offers.		

Are the Romanian workers filling the roles the British workers were applying for?		
No, So, it seems that while there has been a marked interest from British people in the thousands of farm roles, some organisations involved say there have been some difficulties in matching people to suitable roles and contract lengths. The number of foreign workers flown in is a relatively small proportion of the total roles that need to be filled, and the firms say that these workers’ experience is necessary while less experienced British workers are trained up.		

Why are Romanian workers needed as well as British workers?

One 2013 study  looked at how masks could help people with the seasonal flu limit spreading it when they exhale droplets containing the virus. Overall, researchers found masks led to a more than threefold reduction in how much virus people sprayed into the air.

Another study, analyzing data from thousands of Japanese schoolchildren, found that “vaccination and wearing a mask reduced the likelihood of developing seasonal influenza.”

Importantly, researchers also found that flu rates were lower when masks were paired with proper hand hygiene.

In other words, regular handwashing remains an essential tool in preventing the spread of viruses.

Before preparing or eating food, it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day, wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.

It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging. You should always handle and prepare food safely, including keeping raw meat separate from other foods, refrigerating perishable foods, and cooking meat to the right temperature to kill harmful germs.

According to current evidence, COVID-19 virus is transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and
contact routes.1-6

Droplet transmission occurs when a person is in in close contact (within 1 m) with someone who has respiratory
symptoms (e.g. coughing or sneezing,) and is therefore at risk of having his/her mucosae (mouth and nose) or
conjunctiva (eyes) exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets (which are generally considered to
be > 5-10 μm in diameter). Droplet transmission may also occur through fomites in the immediate environment
around the infected person.7
 Therefore, transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur by direct contact with
infected people and indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the
infected person (e.g. stethoscope or thermometer)		

What is the main source of transmission for COVID-19?

Apart from suspect, probable, or confirmed COVID-19 cases, autopsies might be requested for patients not suspected to be SARS-Cov2 positive. Due to the high level of contagion in hospitals and in the general population, any corpse is regarded as potential source of infection. Therefore, for any autopsy, we recommend always to adopt the same biosafety measures as for confirmed COVID-19 cases. In addition, in cases of autopsies without apparent SARS-CoV-2 infection, we recommend (i) to discuss with the clinicians the reason why the post-mortem examination is requested; (ii) and if available, to perform nasal-oropharyngeal swabs on corpses within 2 h of death to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection to implement the safety measures [3].

Amongst others, the U.S. intelligence community warned in its annual threat report for 2019 that “that the United States and the world will remain vulnerable to the next flu pandemic or large-scale outbreak of a contagious disease that could lead to massive rates of death.”		

Did anyone predict that there could be a pandemic or epidemic of Covid-19 proportions prior to March 2020?		
The likelihood of a pandemic has been clear to experts for quite some time.

Back in 2012, the RAND Corp. issued a report called “Threats Without Threateners? Exploring Intersections of Threats to the Global Commons and National Security.” That report focused on five risks — nuclear proliferation, conflict in the Middle East, water scarcity, pandemics and climate change.

Of the five, it said, “In current circumstances, only pandemics seem to be an existential threat, capable of destroying America’s way of life.”

Studies are underway to determine the efficacy in using chloroquine to treat COVID-19.		

Has a timeline been established as to when this drug may be available for use treating Covid-19?		
FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, speaking after the president, said the FDA is considering giving chloroquine to larger populations of coronavirus patients as part of an “expanded use” testing program. Such a trial in patients would allow the FDA to collect data to measure scientifically whether it works. It was not immediately clear how long it would take the FDA to design the study and get it working at trial sites around the country.

The fatality rate of the coronavirus was based on current data available of known positive cases and known deaths.
Oftentimes estimates have to be made because data is just not yet available. The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, used the fatality rate of coronavirus with known numbers and used this as his prediction of eventual mortality rate.  This was a faulty assumption.  Estimates usually involve obtaining information that is available and making estimates on what is not. We cannot tell the future but we can make educated guesses based on information available. This is what has been done with the coronavirus because this type of virus has apparently never been seen before.

2. Sometimes estimates are reasonable and sometimes they are wrong, and even way off.

The point is that whenever estimates are made of large unknown values they are always wrong because no one can tell the future. Sometimes estimates end up close and sometimes they are not and sometimes they are way off.

The estimate used most often is from the WHO based on the Director General’s comments.  The WHO estimates the mortality rate of the coronavirus to be around 3.4%:

The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated the mortality rate from Covid-19 is about 3.4%. That is higher than seasonal flu and is cause for concern – but even if it is correct, more than 96% of people who become infected with the coronavirus will recover.

The History of Pandemics

Pan·dem·ic /panˈdemik/ (of a disease) prevalent over a whole country or the world.

As humans have spread across the world, so have infectious diseases. Even in this modern era, outbreaks are nearly constant, though not every outbreak reaches pandemic level as COVID-19 has.

Today’s visualization outlines some of history’s most deadly pandemics, from the Antonine Plague to the current COVID-19 event.
A Timeline of Historical Pandemics

Disease and illnesses have plagued humanity since the earliest days, our mortal flaw. However, it was not until the marked shift to agrarian communities that the scale and spread of these diseases increased dramatically.

Widespread trade created new opportunities for human and animal interactions that sped up such epidemics. Malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, influenza, smallpox, and others first appeared during these early years.

The more civilized humans became – with larger cities, more exotic trade routes, and increased contact with different populations of people, animals, and ecosystems – the more likely pandemics would occur.

Here are some of the major pandemics that have occurred over time:
Name	Time period	Type / Pre-human host	Death toll
Antonine Plague	165-180	Believed to be either smallpox or measles	5M
Japanese smallpox epidemic	735-737	Variola major virus	1M
Plague of Justinian	541-542	Yersinia pestis bacteria / Rats, fleas	30-50M
Black Death	1347-1351	Yersinia pestis bacteria / Rats, fleas	200M
New World Smallpox Outbreak	1520 – onwards	Variola major virus	56M
Great Plague of London	1665	Yersinia pestis bacteria / Rats, fleas	100,000
Italian plague	1629-1631	Yersinia pestis bacteria / Rats, fleas	1M
Cholera Pandemics 1-6	1817-1923	V. cholerae bacteria	1M+
Third Plague	1885	Yersinia pestis bacteria / Rats, fleas	12M (

Correct. On 10 March 2020, the last two of 16 makeshift hospitals that had been set up in Wuhan to combat the new coronavirus outbreak were closed, according to local news sources and international media. On 18 March 2020, no new Covid-19 cases were reported in the province of Hubei (of which Wuhan is the capital) for the first time since the beginning of the outbreak. Very few cases have been officially reported in Hubei since this date and travel restrictions have begun to be relaxed in the area.

India’s ministry of health has recommended using some of these drugs, but it is not clear how successful they have been so far.

This is true. Researchers from several institutes, including the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, have published a paper (which hasn’t yet been peer-reviewed) that reports on a neutralising antibody for the new coronavirus. Neutralising antibodies are produced by the immune system to protect against viral infection, and are what vaccines aim to induce in the human body.

The company added that stores outside China were to be closed until 27 March (Apple's website now says that these closures are ""until further notice"").		

Did Cleveland Clinic developed a Covid-19 test that gives results in hours, not days ?		
This is not true. The hospital in Ohio has developed a faster way of doing the test that already exists, on its own hospital site. In a press briefing on 12 March, the Cleveland Clinic’s CEO and president told reporters: “Cleveland Clinic has not developed a new test for coronavirus.”However, he did say the clinic has “developed the ability” to test for Covid-19 on site, which would speed up the results from days to hours.		

Did the number of Covid cases in South Korea started declining by mid march 2020 ?		
This was correct when the post first appeared on social media, and at the time of writing. Reported new cases of Covid-19 in South Korea have declined since their peak in late February, and been roughly level since mid-March.		

Was Italy hit hard with Coronavirus only because they have the oldest population in Europe ?		
Older adults and those with underlying health conditions are at a higher risk of getting very ill as a result of Covid-19.

Did America have the health resources to deal with the coronavirus pandemic		
In a March 12 op-ed in the New York Times, health policy experts pointed out that the nation has insufficient hospital beds, even if only 5% of the country contracted the illness at that time the United States had fewer than 800,000 hospital beds, about 68,000 adult intensive care unit beds of any kind, and, even with the strategic reserve, fewer than 100,000 ventilators. As the coronavirus spread, this would not be enough.

If even 5 percent of the 325 million people living in America got Covid-19, the data suggested that 20 percent of them — 3.2 million people — would require hospitalization and 6 percent — 960,000 people — would require beds in intensive care units for many days. Covid-19 patients would have simply overwhelmed the health care system.		

Does the US health care system have adequate ventilators, ICU beds, medical professionals ?		
As the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spreads across the United States, there are continuing concerns among hospitals, public health experts and government leaders that hospital intensive care units would be hard-pressed to handle a surge in seriously ill patients.

A key limiting factor to being able to provide good care, they say, is the number of ventilation machines — ventilators — a hospital has on hand to help the most seriously ill patients breathe.

""The coronavirus, like many respiratory viruses, can cause inflammation in the lungs,"" explains Dr. William Graham Carlos a pulmonary critical care specialist at Indiana University School of Medicine ""And when the lungs become inflamed, the membranes that transfer oxygen from the air into the blood become blocked.""

When patients develop this type of viral pneumonia, they often require bedside ventilators which, Carlos says ""can supply higher levels of oxygen and also help push air into the lungs to open them up, and afford more opportunity to get oxygen into the patient.""		

Is there a Shortage of personal protective equipment endangering health workers worldwide ?		
The World Health Organization has warned that severe and mounting disruption to the global supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) – caused by rising demand, panic buying, hoarding and misuse – is putting lives at risk from the new coronavirus and other infectious diseases.

Healthcare workers rely on personal protective equipment to protect themselves and their patients from being infected and infecting others.

But shortages are leaving doctors, nurses and other frontline workers dangerously ill-equipped to care for COVID-19 patients, due to limited access to supplies such as gloves, medical masks, respirators, goggles, face shields, gowns, and aprons.

“Without secure supply chains, the risk to healthcare workers around the world is real. Industry and governments must act quickly to boost supply, ease export restrictions and put measures in place to stop speculation and hoarding. We can’t stop COVID-19 without protecting health workers first,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, prices have surged. Surgical masks have seen a sixfold increase, N95 respirators have trebled and gowns have doubled.

Supplies can take months to deliver and market manipulation is widespread, with stocks frequently sold to the highest bidder.

The coronavirus pandemic could soon force American physicians to face a tragic challenge — rationing medical care as the number of ill patients overwhelms the supplies, space and staff available in hospitals.

Today, the United States has fewer than 800,000 hospital beds, about 68,000 adult intensive care unit beds of any kind, and, even with the strategic reserve, fewer than 100,000 ventilators. As the coronavirus spreads, this will not be enough.

If even 5 percent of the 325 million people living in America get Covid-19, the current data suggests that 20 percent of them — 3.2 million people — will require hospitalization and 6 percent — 960,000 people — will require beds in intensive care units for many days. Covid-19 patients will simply overwhelm our health care system.		

What is the assessment of health experts regarding the capability of the US healthcare system to handle the number of people who could be infected with the coronavirus?		
The impact of a COVID-19 pandemic on hospitals is expected to be severe in the best of circumstances. Currently, US hospitals routinely operate at or near full capacity and have limited ability to rapidly increase services.
In recent years, there has been a reduction in the overall number of hospitals, hospital beds, and emergency rooms. The provision of medical services to both COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 patients may be adversely affected in most communities…. there are about 46,500 medical ICU beds in the United States and perhaps an equal number of other ICU beds that could be used in a crisis. Even spread out over several months, the mismatch between demand and resources is clear.		

Was there a lack of medical personnel in the US at the time the claim was made in March 2020?		
There are currently shortages of healthcare workers of all kinds. Emergency departments are overcrowded and often have to divert patients to other hospitals.
During an epidemic, the healthcare workforce would be greatly reduced. Healthcare workers would face a high risk of infection because of contact with infected patients; many would need to stay home to care for sick relatives, and, in the absence of vaccine, others might fear coming to work lest they bring a lethal infection home to their families.

On Jan. 15 2020, when the traveler to Wuhan who became the first known U.S. case returned to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, he took group transportation from the airport with other passengers, county officials have said. At the time, 41 people in Wuhan had been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, so named for the crownlike spikes that help them invade cells, and Chinese officials said the threat of human-to-human transmission was low. A CDC notice advised Americans who’d been in Wuhan and felt sick to seek care.

On Jan. 17, the U.S. began checks of passengers from Wuhan at airports in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Two days later, the recent arrival from Wuhan visited the urgent-care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, and the intensive response began. In retrospect, it was already too late. Some researchers who’ve traced the viral genomes of patients around the world now believe someone else in the area picked it up between Jan. 15 and Jan. 19, before the traveler went to the hospital. He might have sneezed in the airport shuttle or on some surface—all but impossible for health workers to trace.

“This virus is more contagious than the flu, so any sort of exposures before he got to the hospital would be certainly of high concern,” said George Diaz, who leads the infectious disease department at Providence, where the patient was treated.		

Who was the first first COVID-19 patient in the United States ?		
The man who would become Patient Zero for the new coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. appeared to do everything right. He arrived Jan. 19 at an urgent-care clinic in a suburb north of Seattle with a slightly elevated temperature and a cough he’d developed soon after returning four days earlier from a visit with family in Wuhan, China. The 35-year-old had seen a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention alert about the virus and decided to get checked. He put on a mask in the waiting room. After learning about his travel, the clinic drew blood and took nasal and throat swabs, and called state and county health officials, who hustled the sample onto an overnight flight to the CDC lab in Atlanta. The patient was told to stay in isolation at home, and health officials checked on him the next morning.		

Where was the origin of the first COVID-19 virus case in the United States ?		
After a US patient contracted novel coronavirus and left medical authorities no clues as to where it came from, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has begun sending out new testing guidance to health care workers, the top CDC official said Thursday.
A patient in California who has cornonavirus didn't travel anywhere known to have the virus, the CDC announced Wednesday night. And the patient wasn't exposed to anyone known to be infected.
The patient is in serious condition, Rep. John Garamendi, who represents the district in California where the patient is from, told CNN's ""OutFront with Erin Burnett.

BCG, or bacille Calmette-Guerin, is a vaccine for tuberculosis (TB) disease. Many foreign-born persons have been BCG-vaccinated. BCG is used in many countries with a high prevalence of TB to prevent childhood tuberculous meningitis and miliary disease. However, BCG is not generally recommended for use in the United States because of the low risk of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the variable effectiveness of the vaccine against adult pulmonary TB, and the vaccine’s potential interference with tuberculin skin test reactivity. The BCG vaccine should be considered only for very select persons who meet specific criteria and in consultation with a TB expert.

1145,COLLOIDAL SILVER KILLS CORONAVIRUS,"What is Colloidal Silver?		
Colloidal silver is a solution that consists of very small silver particles suspended in a liquid. A “colloid” is a liquid that evenly distributes certain particles within it.

Some people take colloidal silver by mouth as a dietary supplement. Many internet-based sources claim that colloidal silver has a range of health benefits.

However, there is little scientific evidence to support these claims, and ingesting silver may have mild to severe health consequences.		

What has the FDA said about Colloidal Silver?		
In the Federal Register of October 15,
1996 (61 FR 53685), FDA published a
proposed rule to declare that all OTC
drug products containing colloidal
silver ingredients or silver salts are not
generally recognized as safe and
effective, and are new drugs and
misbranded within the meaning of
section 201(p) of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21
U.S.C. 321(p)). Colloidal silver is a
suspension of silver particles in a
colloidal base. In recent years, colloidal
silver preparations of unknown
formulation have been appearing in
retail outlets. These products are labeled
for numerous disease conditions, many
of which are serious diseases. The
dosage form of these colloidal silver
products is usually oral, but product
labeling also contains directions for
topical and, occasionally, intravenous
use.
FDA has not approved a new drug
application (NDA) for any colloidal
silver product. None of the silver salts
evaluated as part of FDA’s OTC drug
review was found to be generally
recognized as safe and effective for its
intended use(s). FDA is not aware of any
substantial scientific evidence that
supports the use of OTC colloidal silver
ingredients or silver salts for disease
conditions.		

Is there any evidence of Colloidal silver curing coronavirus?		
“There are no complementary products, such as colloidal silver or herbal remedies, that have been proven effective in preventing or treating this disease (COVID-19), and colloidal silver can have serious side effects,” Dr. Helene Langevin, National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health director, said in a statement.

What is communism?		
political and economic doctrine that aims to replace private property and a profit-based economy with public ownership and communal control of at least the major means of production (e.g., mines, mills, and factories) and the natural resources of a society. Communism is thus a form of socialism—a higher and more advanced form, according to its advocates. Exactly how communism differs from socialism has long been a matter of debate, but the distinction rests largely on the communists’ adherence to the revolutionary socialism of Karl Marx.

“Yes. It’s horseshit,” added Gen. Michael Hayden, via Twitter. Hayden served as director of the CIA from 2006 to Feb. 12, 2009, shortly after Obama took office.

Ben Rhodes, former deputy national security adviser to Obama, added his voice on Twitter as well: “Trump is lying. I was there for all 8 years. Obama never sought a meeting with Kim Jong Un. Foreign policy isn’t reality television it’s reality.”

Rhodes told CNN that Obama “never even considered” seeking a meeting with Kim. “There’s no mystery here: It’s just a lie with no supporting evidence and no basis in anything. It’s not even an exaggeration, it’s just not true.”

And on CNN’s “State of the Union,” James Clapper, who served as director of national intelligence for most of Obama’s presidency, said he was puzzled by Trump’s claim. “In all the deliberations that I have participated in on North Korea during the Obama administration, I can recall no instance whatever where President Obama ever indicated any interest whatsoever in meeting with the — Chairman Kim,” Clapper said.

The CDC developed its own test for the virus rather than employing a German-developed one used by the World Health Organization.

Canada will welcome nearly one million immigrants over the next three years, according to the multi-year strategy tabled by the Liberal government today in what it calls ""the most ambitious immigration levels in recent history. The number of economic migrants, family reunifications and refugees will climb to 310,000 in 2018, up from 300,000 this year. That number will rise to 330,000 in 2019 then 340,000 in 2020. The targets for economic migrants, refugees and family members was tabled in the House of Commons Wednesday afternoon. Hussen said the new targets will bring Canada's immigration to nearly one per cent of the population by 2020, which will help offset an aging demographic. He called it a historic and responsible plan and ""the most ambitious"" in recent history. ""Our government believes that newcomers play a vital role in our society,"" Hussen said. ""Five million Canadians are set to retire by 2035 and we have fewer people working to support seniors and retirees.""		

Does the Canadian government had plan of welcome three million immigrants in 2020 ?		
November 1, 2017 – Ottawa plans to welcome 980,000 new immigrants over the next three years under an ambitious three-year immigration plan announced by the federal government on Nov. 1. Annual immigration levels could rise to as high as 360,000 by 2020 under the multi-year plan. This would be first time in more than a century that our immigration rate is 1% of our population.

Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen described the announcement as ‘historic’, as the government outlines its plan for the next three years, featuring managed increases across all categories.

In 2018, the immigration target will rise to 310,000, from the current 300,000 set for 2017. This target could rise to as much as 330,000 under the latest announcement. In 2019, the target will be 330,000, with an upper limit of 350,000 new immigrants. In 2020, the target figure will be 340,000, and the upper limit 360,000.

The latest plan will drive up immigration numbers to historic levels as the government pushes the annual number of newcomers towards 1 per cent of Canada’s population a target first used by the Liberals in the early 1990’s. The current levels of 300,000 correspond into an immigration rate near .82 per cent.

Yes, In an interview with International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde, Bloomberg said, ""What we found was that there were a handful of people who signed up under different names, and they were getting four or five times the amount that they were supposed to get, which meant that we couldn’t take care of some of the people who really deserved it. … So what we did is we fingerprinted people so you could only register once. Now, there was a lot of yelling and screaming and saying we’re invading your personal space by looking at your fingerprints. Well that may be, but you can’t come to work for New York City unless we fingerprint you first, so it is not unreasonable to think the beneficiaries of our program would get fingerprinted, too, and we’re just stopping people from breaking the law, which is hurting other people.""		

What is the correct format for this claim?		
First of all, what the U.S. is doing is immoral. I know that’s not a phrase they often use in politics, but it’s immoral. Look what President Donald Trump is doing right—look what this president’s doing right now. Look at what people have done before. They’re going to fingerprint food stamp recipients.

The NYPD stopped and interrogated people 684,330 times in 2011, by far the highest total since the Police Department began collecting data on its troubling stop-and-frisk program in 2002. This represents a 603 percent increase in stop-and-frisks since that year, the first year of the Bloomberg administration, when there were only 97,296 stops.

Was the stop-and-frisk policy challenged?		
Yes, In 2012 the NYCLU sued the NYPD over stop-and-frisk abuse at private residential buildings, and in January 2013 a federal court found widespread constitutional violations. In August 2013 the court found similar violations in a much broader case brought by the Center for Constitutional Rights challenging street stops generally.		

Does Bloomberg support the stop-and-frisk policy?		
Yes, Bloomberg made it clear that he absolutely supported stop-and-frisk, and dismissed critics as a vocal minority		

Does Bloomberg support the stop-and-frisk policy?		
Yes, “I would suggest to the next mayor, whoever it is, that saving lives is the most important thing, more so than pandering. Stop-and-frisk has been shown to be—not the only, but the most effective, tool in getting guns out of the hands of kids.”		

Did Bloomberg cut the stop and frisk checking to 95 % ?		
The reduction Bloomberg touted is based on a comparison of data from the beginning of 2012 and the end of 2013, the end of his time in office. 

But as Bloomberg himself acknowledged, stop and frisks had ballooned before that period under his watch. The declines toward the end of his tenure came as the city faced public criticism over the policy and a lawsuit that questioned the legality of the police behavior and its impact on minorities. So while there was ultimately a sharp decline, Bloomberg had presided over a sharp increase in stop and frisks for most of his time as mayor.
He did actually reduce stop & frisk to a great extent. Si I rate this claim as refuted.

A 2014 WHO report outlines three commonly used consent processes for vaccination programs: written, verbal and implied.		

According to the WHO, is a child appearing in school tantamount to giving consent for vaccination		
Some laws and regulations are
in place that identify school- or social-services
officials as appointed guardians for children
and adolescents not living with their parents,
including adolescents in boarding school. This is
also called “third party consent”. In such cases,
these third parties can provide consent for
medical care, including vaccination of specific,
individual children.		

How does informed consent work, would parents be contacted in various ways before the consent is implied?		
An implied consent process by which
parents are informed of imminent vaccination
through social mobilization and communication,
sometimes including letters directly addressed to
the parents.		

So if after these communications a parent has not opted out, does a child being at school imply consent?		
Subsequently, the physical presence
of the child or adolescent, with or without an

Key facts
Plague is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, a zoonotic bacteria usually found in small mammals and their fleas.
People infected with Y. pestis often develop symptoms after an incubation period of one to seven days.
There are two main clinical forms of plague infection: bubonic and pneumonic. Bubonic plague is the most common form and is characterized by painful swollen lymph nodes or 'buboes'.
Plague is transmitted between animals and humans by the bite of infected fleas, direct contact with infected tissues, and inhalation of infected respiratory droplets.
Plague can be a very severe disease in people, with a case-fatality ratio of 30% to 60% for the bubonic type, and is always fatal for the pneumonic kind when left untreated.
Antibiotic treatment is effective against plague bacteria, so early diagnosis and early treatment can save lives.
From 2010 to 2015 there were 3248 cases reported worldwide, including 584 deaths.
Currently, the three most endemic countries are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, and Peru.
Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, a zoonotic bacteria, usually found in small mammals and their fleas. It is transmitted between animals through fleas. Humans can be infected through:
the bite of infected vector fleas
unprotected contact with infectious bodily fluids or contaminated materials
the inhalation of respiratory droplets/small particles from a patient with pneumonic plague.

Police officers responding to an active shooter are trained in a procedure known as Rapid Deployment and are supposed to proceed immediately to the area in which shots were last heard; their purpose is to stop the shooting as quickly as possible. The first responding officers will normally be in teams of four (4); they may be dressed in regular patrol uniforms, or they may be wearing external bulletproof vests, Kevlar helmets, and other tactical equipment. The officers may be armed with rifles, shotguns, or handguns, and might also be using pepper spray or tear gas to control the situation. There's nothing safe about a single officer running to confront a potential murderer or a terrorist

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 

The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).

1318,"Comedian, Samuel Whitcomb Hyde is behind the spread of Coronavirus.","How did the spread of covid-19 likely occur?		
In late December, the World Health Organization learned that several patients in Wuhan, China had contracted pneumonia from a virus that did not match any known viruses. In early January, officials in China concluded that the virus was a new coronavirus, a group of viruses that can cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome, known as SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, known as MERS.		

How did the spread of covid-19 likely occur?		
A number of outbreaks in mink farms in the Netherlands, Denmark and Spain have shown that minks can spread the disease in farm environment and could potentially establish a new animal reservoir in mink populations for SARS-CoV-2 if not efficiently controlled.
These preliminary results demonstrate that different animal species in regular contacts with humans are susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and could serve as intermediate animal host species or could establish new reservoirs for the virus and new sources for spill-over events into the human population.		

Where did Coronavirus originate?		
Bats are natural reservoirs of coronaviruses, and likely harbor many other coronaviruses not yet discovered. However, while direct spillover of a new virus from bats to humans is possible, zoonoses often stem from exposure to intermediate animal hosts. Research conducted in China and elsewhere since the COVID-19 pandemic began has shown that a range of animals – including wild and farmed species – are susceptible to infection, but when and where SARS-CoV-2 spilled over to humans, and from which animal, remains unknown.		

Where was the first COVID outbreak detected?		
Where an epidemic is first detected does not necessarily reflect where it started. An outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology was identified through surveillance in Wuhan, however the possibility that the virus may have silently circulated elsewhere cannot be ruled out. For example, some countries have retrospectively identified cases of COVID-19 weeks before the first case was officially notified through surveillance, and unpublished reports of positive sewage samples could suggest that the virus may have circulated undetected for some time. The COVID-19 outbreak was first reported in Wuhan, where the SARS-CoV-2 virus was also first identified and characterized. The detection was followed by a rapid exponentially growing outbreak, weeks before other outbreaks were detected elsewhere. Thus, under the framework of global tracing for the origins of SARS-CoV-2, the approach to identifying the source of infection, the source of introduction and possible origins of the virus initially conducted in Wuhan is of importance for further global origin tracing work.		

Was Coronavirus man-made?		
A research article cited by thousands states - SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans; SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe disease, whereas HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E are associated with mild symptoms6. Here we review what can be deduced about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 from comparative analysis of genomic data. We offer a perspective on the notable features of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and discuss scenarios by which they could have arisen. Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.		

Was the spread of coronavirus deliberate?		
Absent that, the burden of proof that this outbreak did not occur naturally is high, because as mentioned above, there are a lot of reasons to suggest that Covid-19 is exactly what it appears to be – an infectious coronavirus that spilled over from bats into a population that has already experienced a previous spillover event from a related virus. And regardless of its origin, we still need to handle it in the same way: social distancing, mask wearing, increased testing and contact tracing until a reliable therapy or vaccine is developed.		

Was the spread of coronavirus deliberate?		
The latest accusation that the virus was engineered came from a Norwegian team of scientists, which was swiftly attacked by other virologists, who argued that the viral genetic material is similar to other viruses found in nature Still, adding fuel to the debate is the revelation that scientists from the Wuhan lab published articles that described manipulating coronaviruses (so called “gain of function” experiments) - thereby producing all the ingredients for conspiracy theories and suspicions of nefarious intent.		

Did the coronavirus spread naturally?		
A genetic study of samples from more than 7,500 people infected with COVID-19 suggests the new coronavirus spread quickly around the world after it emerged in China sometime between October and December last year, scientists say. 

Scientists at University College London’s Genetics Institute found almost 200 recurrent genetic mutations of the new coronavirus - SARS-CoV-2 - which the UCL researchers said showed how it is adapting to its human hosts as it spreads.

“Phylogenetic estimates support that the COVID-2 pandemic started sometime around Oct. 6, 2019 to Dec. 11, 2019, which corresponds to the time of the host jump into humans,” the research team, co-led by Francois Balloux, wrote in a study published in the journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution.

Balloux said the analysis also found that the virus was and is mutating, as normally happens with viruses, and that a large proportion of the global genetic diversity of the virus causing COVID-19 was found in all of the hardest-hit countries.

That suggests SARS-CoV-2 was being transmitted extensively around the world from early on in the epidemic, he said.		

Was there anything reported by police or public authorities to support criminal offence accusations for Sam Hyde?		
No, There were no official reports found regarding Sam Hyde being connected to the spread of coronavirus. Articles such as the one below seem to conclude that such social media claims about this person are unverified and belong to what is the spread of disinformation online. -  The people that we study that use media to manipulate other people know that, and they know that there are times when information is critical, during—especially what we study during breaking news cycles, where we see a lot of what we call source hacking, which is hacking source material. It’s making shit up—(laughter)—so that in the moment they can piggyback their ideas or their political opinions into the story. So it doesn’t surprise my research lab every time we see a mass shooting that we see the misidentification of certain mass shooters that identify either this young internet comedian named Sam Hyde, or Antifa is a popular—a popular conspiracy theory, or crisis actors. And in these moments we know what to look for because we are a highly skilled research lab, but it doesn’t mean that anyone that’s popping onto Twitter that are looking at these keywords knows the difference between one of these posts that is targeted disinformation and one of these posts that is maybe what we call misinformation, is information that’s being circulated in the moment but we all know it’s unverified.

1332,Presidential candidate Joe Biden fought for decades to cut social security in the US.,"Did Joe Biden called for cut social security in the US?		
Biden had an ambivalent relationship with government spending. Considered in the 1980s to be one of the Democratic Party’s new ​“neoliberals,” Biden called then for a spending freeze on Social Security and a higher Social Security retirement age. In 1995, he cast his vote for a balanced budget constitutional amendment, despite his earlier criticisms of it. The choice was, he said, ​“an imperfect amendment or continued spending.” When he ran for president 12 years later, he again called for the Social Security retirement age to go up.

In journalist Bob Woodward’s 2012 book The Price of Politics, he portrays Biden during Obama’s first term eager to sacrifice Social Security and Medicare for the sake of bipartisan compromise and achieving what would be, in the eyes of Washington, a political victory.

Biden first displayed his friendliness to GOP entitlement hawks when he appointed former Wyoming Sen. Alan Simpson to co-chair the president’s National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility, created in February 2010 via executive order. Simpson was one of Congress’s most high-profile foes of entitlements and a proponent of Social Security privatization. In Woodward’s telling, Biden even had to lightly pressure a somewhat reluctant Simpson to take the role.

Sure enough, the Simpson-Bowles Commission, as it came to be known, recommended cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, leading liberal economist Paul Krugman to label the commission ​“terrible.” Failing to secure enough votes from the commission to recommend the plan to Congress, the proposals were never taken up.

But Biden took a far more direct role in undermining Social Security and Medicare when he headed tax policy negotiations with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in December 2010. In Woodward’s telling, Biden’s eagerness to cut a deal with the Republicans sometimes elicited outrage from his fellow Democrats, who felt he was giving too much away.

In 1984 he proposed freezing Social Security benefits — that is, ending cost-of-living adjustments that boost benefits to keep up with inflation. In January 1995 he gave a speech endorsing a balanced budget amendment (an utterly lunatic policy) and boasted about his previous record of proposing ""that we freeze every single solitary program in the government, anything the government had to do with, every single solitary one, that we not spend a penny more, not even accounting for inflation, than we spent the year before."" In November 1995 he did so again, boasting that ""I tried with Senator Grassley back in the '80s to freeze all government spending, including Social Security, including everything.""

What are 'crisis actors'?		
A crisis actor (aka actor-patient or actor victim) is a trained actor, role player, volunteer, or other person engaged to portray a disaster victim during emergency drills to train first responders such as police, firefighters or EMS personnel. Crisis actors are used to create high-fidelity simulations of disasters in order to allow first responders to practice their skills and help emergency services to prepare and train in realistic scenarios as part of full-scale disaster exercises. 

Conspiracy theories and defamation - In the United States, the term has been used by conspiracy theorists who claim that mass shootings and other disasters are staged, and victims and their families are being played by crisis actors in order to pass gun control laws. Conspiracy theorists' use of the term is thought to have originated in 2012, when a blog post by former professor and professional conspiracy theorist James Tracy suggested that the government could have hired an acting agency named Visionbox to help stage the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Visionbox offered dramatic training ""in criminal and victim behavior"" to actors intended to help ""bring intense realism to simulated mass casualty incidents in public places"".

Yes, In regard to the Madison case, Trump’s campaign referred us to the case of Luis Ruiz-Ugalde.

1371,Images show wombats taking animals into their burrows in a bid to protect them from bushfires in Australia,"Do wombats share their burrows with other animals?		
Yes, In a research article titled “Interspecies co-use of southern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus latifrons) burrows”, which was published in the scientific journal Australian Mammalogy in 2016, scientists said, in part:

“Burrow use was monitored using 34 motion-activated cameras placed outside wombat burrows between March and September 2015. Eleven species were found to use burrows, with six commensal species observed using burrows on numerous occasions. These included two mammal species (black-footed rock-wallaby, Petrogale lateralis pearsoni; brush-tailed bettong, Bettongia penicillata), three reptile species (peninsula dragon, Ctenophorus fionni; southern sand-skink, Liopholis multiscutata; White’s skink, Liopholis whitii), and one avian species (little penguin, Eudyptula minor). 

“The most common species observed using burrows was the black-footed rock-wallaby, which was recorded using burrows 1795 times.”		

Are these animals invited in or taken in by wombats?		
No, Wombats definitely do not shepherd other animals into their burrows. It is possible that this idea arose because someone saw an animal either follow a wombat into its burrow, or the other animals went in first followed by the wombats.

“Wombats generally are fairly tolerant of other animals. This may be because they have few real predators so they don't feel threatened by most animals, especially those that are small enough to fit in their burrows. They do interact with other animals on occasion.”  Although unintentional, the refuge wombats provide for other animals has proved crucial in protecting them against raging bushfires.

The “Empire” actor first claimed that early in the morning on Jan. 29, 2019, two men came up to him in the bitter cold on Lower North Water Street as he was heading to his apartment. He said they yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, told him “this is MAGA country,” poured a chemical on him and put a rope around his neck.

But as police investigated the case, they began saying that indicators pointed to Smollett orchestrating the attack. Police concluded that Smollett paid two brothers – Abel and Ola Osundairo – to stage the attack, because he was upset with his salary on his Fox show.

Smollett was indicted on 16 counts of disorderly conduct in March,		

how was the case resolved		
the office of Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx dismissed the case without a plea, after Smollett agreed to surrender his $10,000 bail and perform 16 hours of community service.		

were the charges against Jessie Smollett reinstated		
Webb took on the case for free after a judge appointed him to investigate the circumstances that led the state’s attorney’s office to drop the initial charges against Smollett.

Though Webb found no evidence of criminal misconduct by Foxx and her staff in the office’s decision to drop the charges, he accused the county’s top prosecutor of “substantial abuses of discretion.”

Webb’s full report on his finding remains under seal and has not been released to the public.

W2 Fuel, a southeast Iowa biodiesel plant, has shut down in response to the unclear future for the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS). The Crawfordsville, Iowa plant produced 10 million gallons of biodiesel annually. The shutdown will put 50 people out of work, according to the Des Moines Register. In addition to the Iowa plant’s shutdown, the owners will also close the doors of a plant in Michigan.ould tread water for a little while, but I came to a point where I was underwater. I couldn’t make a profit at all. I was bleeding cash,” said Roy Strom, CEO of W2 Fuel to reporters at the Des Moines Register.

This is the third plant in Iowa alone to announce it will shut down following small refinery exemptions (SRE) to RFS. Similar announcements have been made in other states.

Earlier this month, Siouxland Energy Cooperative in Sioux Center, Iowa announced it would idle production over SREs.

“The administration’s actions unfairly benefit the oil industry at the expense of our local farmers and if not addressed soon, will impact the livelihoods of many,” said Kevin Neiuwenhuis, president of the board for the plant in a recent press release.

In early August the Trump administration granted 31 additional SRE waivers. Six additional waiver requests were either withdrawn or denied.

“The vast majority of these exemptions are not justified under the law,” said Iowa Renewable Fuels Association (IRFA) Executive Director Monte Shaw in a press release. “Since this news began to leak this afternoon, RFS credit prices have freefallen to nearly zero, destroying much of the incentive to blend an incremental gallon of ethanol.”

Penalties for Driving Without a License
Failure to produce a valid driver's license when asked by a police officer can lead to a number of penalties depending on the circumstances. Charges typically fall into one of two categories: correctable offenses and willful violations.

Correctable Offenses

Simply forgetting to carry your driver's license while driving a vehicle may lead to a ""fix-it ticket,"" where you must later show proof that you fixed the violation in order to have the citation dismissed by the traffic court. Failure to present this evidence typically leads to fines or other penalties.

Willful Violations

Penalties for willful violations of licensing requirements, such as driving on a suspended or revoked license, are much more serious. Driver's licenses are frequently suspended for DUI offenses, since states have an interest in keeping dangerous drivers off the roads. Therefore, when a driver willfully drives with a suspended or revoked driver's license, they may be cited, arrested, and charged with a misdemeanor offense.

The Iranian government masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy.  It has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed, and chaos.  The longest-suffering victims of Iran’s leaders are, in fact, its own people. Rather than use its resources to improve Iranian lives, its oil profits go to fund Hezbollah and other terrorists that kill innocent Muslims and attack their peaceful Arab and Israeli neighbors.  This wealth, which rightly belongs to Iran’s people, also goes to shore up Bashar al-Assad’s dictatorship, fuel Yemen’s civil war, and undermine peace throughout the entire Middle East.We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles, and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program. The Iran Deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.  Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and I don’t think you’ve heard the last of it — believe me.		

When did Trump Threatened to destroy Iran ?		
Trump has responded to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s comments suggesting that the White House is “mentally disabled,” and Trump is “afflicted by a mental disorder.” Rouhani questioned Trump’s mental faculties in response to new sanctions imposed on Iranian officials by Trump. “The White House actions show it is mentally retarded,” said Rouhani, calling them “outrageous and idiotic.” He also accused the US of lying about wanting to resume talks between the two countries. “You say you really want to hold talks with us, but at the same time you’re saying that you want to boycott and sanction our foreign minister, so you’re lying,” he said. The comments seemed to hit home, triggering an emotional response from Trump on Twitter. “Iran leadership doesn’t understand the words ‘nice’ or ‘compassion,’ they never have. Sadly, the thing they do understand is Strength and Power, and the USA is by far the most powerful Military Force in the world, with 1.5 Trillion Dollars invested over the last two years alone,” he tweeted. “The U.S. has not forgotten Iran’s use of IED’s & EFP’s (bombs), which killed 2000 Americans, and wounded many more … Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration.” The statements from Trump seem to contradict other US officials, who say the US wants to negotiate with Iran rather than escalate the dispute. “The United States is not looking to go to war with Iran,” said Mark T. Esper, the acting defense secretary. “Rather, we want to get to a diplomatic path.” Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, also insisted the president remained open to real negotiations and “all that Iran needs to do is walk through that open door.”		

Did Trump threaten to destroy Iran?

Who is Mitch McConnell?		
Senator of Kentucky		

Did Kentucky get a $97 million contract from the US government?		
June 8, 2018
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced today that the U.S. Department of Transportation awarded a $67 million federal grant to the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC) to fund much-needed improvements to Interstate 75 (I-75)/ Interstate 71 (I-71) in Boone County. Senator McConnell contacted the department to support his constituent’s application to the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America (INFRA) competitive federal grant program.		

When did McConnell announce his re-election bid?		
06/08/2018
McConnell formally announced Saturday his plans to seek a seventh term, speaking at a Republican breakfast in western Kentucky ahead of the Fancy Farm picnic, which is the bipartisan political event of the year in the commonwealth.

“I’m going to be running for re-election in 2020,” McConnell said. “I don’t like starting late.”		

How much grant did the Department of transportation send to Kentucky		
Northern Kentucky will get $67.4 million from the federal government to address traffic problems on Interstate 75.

No, it’s not for the Brent Spence Bridge, that’ll require $2.5 billion, but a little further south in Boone County.

Kentucky was given the money Friday to rebuild two I-75/I-71 interchanges in Boone County as part of President Donald Trump's pledge to rebuild America's infrastructure.		

When did Mitch McConnell announce his re-election plan		
McConnell formally announced Saturday his plans to seek a seventh term, speaking at a Republican breakfast in western Kentucky ahead of the Fancy Farm picnic, which is the bipartisan political event of the year in the commonwealth.

“I’m going to be running for re-election in 2020,” McConnell said. “I don’t like starting late.”

The McConnell announcement was not exactly a surprise.		

How was the grant tied to his re-election		
Chao’s designation of Inman as a special intermediary for Kentucky — a privilege other states did not enjoy — gave a special advantage to projects favored by her husband, which could in turn benefit his political interests. In such situations, ethicists say, each member of a couple benefits personally from the success of the other.

“Where a Cabinet secretary is doing things that are going to help her husband get reelected, that starts to rise to the level of feeling more like corruption to the average American. … I do think there are people who will see that as sort of ‘swamp behavior,’” said John Hudak, a Brookings Institution scholar who has studied political influence in federal grant-making.

In fact, days after launching his 2020 reelection campaign McConnell asked Owensboro’s mayor to set up a luncheon with business and political leaders at which the senator claimed credit for delivering the grant.

False Information. Checked by independent fact-checkers.		

Is the stated claim credible?		
No, This post includes inaccurate information about different types of scams. The top portion references the one-ring call scam, which you can find more about here. The purpose of the scam is to get consumers to unknowingly call back international phone numbers and incur charges from international rates or other connection fees.

This section ""they can copy your contact list in 3sec and if you have a bank or credit details on your phone, they can copy that too"" is false and does not apply to this type of scam.		

What is an example of a real phone call scam?		
Every time you call, you will be charged high international rates or other connection fees. The bad guy gets all or part of those fees.

A new example of how the bad guys try to keep you on the phone is by telling you: “You’ve received a song from someone who loves you. After listening to this song you will find out who sent this song as a gift.” The longer you stay on the call, the more you pay. And the more the bad guy makes.

""A former FBI lawyer is under criminal investigation after allegedly altering a document related to 2016 surveillance of a Trump campaign adviser, several people briefed on the matter told CNN.

The possibility of a substantive change to an investigative document is likely to fuel accusations from President Donald Trump and his allies that the FBI committed wrongdoing in its investigation of connections between Russian election meddling and the Trump campaign.””		

Does the CNN article on which the claim is based state that the Russian collusion theory is a hoax?		
No, There is no mention of the Russian collusion theory being a hoax, the article states:
“American intelligence agencies and the Justice Department have not swayed from their finding that Russia interfered in the 2016 election by hacking the Democrats and spreading pro-Trump propaganda online.

Gerrymandering in the United States has been used to increase the power of a political party. Gerrymandering is the practice of setting boundaries of electoral districts to favor specific political interests within legislative bodies, often resulting in districts with convoluted, winding boundaries rather than compact areas. The term ""gerrymandering"" was coined after a review of Massachusetts's redistricting maps of 1812 set by Governor Elbridge Gerry noted that one of the districts looked like a salamander.		

What is redistrictng in the US?		
In the United States, redistricting takes place in each state about every ten years, after the decennial census. It defines geographical boundaries, with each district within a state being geographically contiguous and having about the same number of state voters. The resulting map affects the elections of the state's members of the United States House of Representatives and the state legislative bodies.

How is the NHS funded?		
How is the NHS in England currently funded?

The NHS is funded mainly through general taxation supplemented by National Insurance contributions.

While the NHS is generally described as being ‘free at the point of use’, patients have been required to contribute towards the cost of some services (eg, prescriptions and dental treatment) since 1951. Exemption arrangements are in place that cover many patients, including those aged under 16 or 60 and over, as well as recipients of specific state benefits. The exemptions in place resulted in 90 per cent of all prescription items in England being dispensed free of charge last year (Health and Social Care Information Centre 2016).

The relative contribution from each of these sources of finance – general taxation, National Insurance and user charges – has fluctuated over the years (see Commission on the Future of Health and Social Care in England 2014b). For example, the proportion of income from user charges, from a high of 5 per cent in 1960 remained at 1.2 per cent between 2007 and 2011 (Hawe and Cockcroft 2013).		

Does the government plan on raising the immigration health surcharge?		
At the moment, those coming from outside Europe to visit the UK for more than six months must pay the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) – an annual £400 charge for NHS care, or £300 if they are students.

But the new analysis by officials at the Department of Health and Social Care has concluded that each payer of the IHS ends up costing the NHS an average of £625 a year.		

Will the increase in the immigration health surcharge raise over £500 million a year?

The clean slate will open up prime opportunities for the president-elect to reward political supporters with posts in London, Paris, Tokyo and the like. The notice to diplomatic posts was issued this week.

Political ambassadors sometimes are permitted to stay on briefly during a new administration, but the sweeping nature of the directive suggests that Obama has little interest in retaining any of Bush's ambassadorial appointees.

One way in which economists measure the performance of an economy is by looking at a widely used measure of total output called gross domestic product (GDP).		

How is  a country's economic health measured?		
All the world’s economies share three main goals:

Growth
High employment
Price stability		

What was the job creation growth during Trump's administration?		
Obama created 1.6 million more jobs than Trump over a three-year period.


President Trump’s best year of job growth was 2.314 million in 2018 (the first year of the tax cut) but it falls short of any of Obama’s last three years.		

What the overall employment rate like under Trump's administration?		
...the unemployment rate fell to 8.4 percent as the country emerged from pandemic lockdowns, but the data shows the recovery is losing steam.

Nearly a quarter of the August employment gains were in government jobs, particularly temporary work for the 2020 census, and employment in the world's largest economy remains 11.5 million positions or 7.6 percent below the level in February, before the coronavirus pandemic struck.		

What the overall employment rate like under Trump's administration?		
""The recovery is rapidly decelerating and we still have half of the lost jobs to get back. That shouldn't be happening,"" Adam Ozimek, chief economist at freelancing platform Upwork...

Scientists tell U.N. Global Climate Summit: No emergency

Climate Intelligence Foundation calls for UN meeting with experts from both sides of debate

 ....last week’s U.N. Global Climate Summit were the 500 international scientists, engineers and other stakeholders sounding a very different message: “There is no climate emergency.”

The signers asked Mr. Guterres to place the declaration on the UN’s agenda for the meeting ending Monday—which hasn’t happened—and organize a meeting of scientists “on both sides of the climate debate early in 2020.”		

What did the media report about the claim that more than 500 scientists and professionals in climate and related fields have sent a 'European Climate Declaration' to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.?		
The Independent UK published on Wednesday 25 September 2019 :

Hundreds of climate change deniers including academics, politicians and lobbyists are to launch a campaign to stop commitments to net zero carbon emissions being enshrined in law, The Independent can reveal.

A letter titled “There is no climate emergency” – which has been signed by 400 people who deem climate change to be a myth – is being sent to leaders of European Union (EU) and United Nations (UN) institutions in the coming weeks ahead of key environment talks.		

Who was responsible for the declaration letter?		
The European Climate Declaration was spearheaded by the Amsterdam-based Climate Intelligence Foundation [CLINTEL].		

What credibility has been placed on the declaration?		
The letter has been criticized by six scientists who claim that its credibility is very low. One complaint is that most of the 500 are not experts in ""climate science.""		

What credibility has been placed on the declaration?		
The letter uses the phrasing ""more than 500 knowledgeable and experienced scientists and professionals in climate and related fields"". Not all are ""scientists"" as per the title that the OP wrote. As seen above, one person is simply listed as being an ""author"" and another is listed as ""PhD in Law, author of several books"".		

What credibility has been placed on the declaration?		
...the sheer number of prominent signers with scientific and engineering credentials belied the contention that only a handful of fringe researchers and fossil-fuel shills oppose the climate-catastrophe “consensus.”

The U.S. contingent was made up of 45 U.S. professors, engineers and scientists, including MIT professor emeritus Richard Lindzen; Freeman Dyson of the Institute of Advanced Studies at Princeton, and Stanford University professor emeritus Elliott D.

The Great Recession.
Bank loans were going sour. Bank stock prices were in free fall. Big-name firms were outright failing or on the brink.

As the housing bubble popped and the most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression tightened its grip on the US economy, the situation swiftly became an all-hands-on-deck state of affairs for the Federal Reserve, which supervises bank holding companies and state member banks to ensure they're safe and sound.		

What is this claim based on?		
Federal Reserve's 'astounding' report: We loaned banks trillions
The Federal Reserve offers details on the loans it gave to banks and others at the height of the financial crisis. One program alone doled out nearly $9 trillion.		

What is this claim based on?		
The emergency loans, in the view of many finance experts, helped to avert a much deeper economic slump. And those loans have now been largely paid back without losses to the central bank.		

What did the Federal Bank do to combat the Great Recession?		
The emergency liquidity programs that the Federal Reserve set up provided secured and mostly short-term loans.
The Federal Reserve also provided credit to several systemically important financial institutions. These actions were taken to avoid the disorderly failure of these institutions and the potential catastrophic consequences for the U.S. financial system and economy. All extensions of credit were fully secured and are in the process of being fully repaid.
Finally, the Federal Reserve provided economic stimulus by lowering interest rates. Over the course of the crisis, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reduced its target for the federal funds rate to a range of 0 to 1/4 percent.		

Were the interest rates zero?		
No, Interest rates were very low, but not at zero.

Denmark’s Ministry of Environment and Food, based on a 2018 government study		

What does the study statistics show us about the use of cotton totes ?		
The study found that it takes about 20,000 uses of an organic cotton bag to have the same environmental impact of using a plastic bag

Organic cotton bags: Reuse for grocery shopping at least 149 times for climate change, at
least 20000 times considering all indicators; reuse as waste bin bag if possible, otherwise
incinerate.		

What are the disadvantages of using plastic bags vs cotton bags?		
Plastic bags are mostly made of non-sustainable materials. Their production has a big carbon footprint and pollute soils and water. Plastic never disappear, it spread into small pieces that pollutes the ocean and lands. These microbeads have a direct impact on our health as the enter the food chain.

6- Do not forget that plastic bags are almost never recycled. The cost of their recycling is higher than their value, that is why the usually end in waste incinerators, landfills or in the sea.		

Does the report show that a cotton bag can be used 20000 times before it has the same impact as a plastic bag?		
No. The report shows that a cotton bag must be used 20000 times to have the SAME impact as a plastic bag. This is a negative thing. It is because of the resources (water and power) used to make the cotton bag.		

Do tote bags made from cotton harm the environment?		
The claim does not ask for comparison against plastic bags. It asks if cotton bags harm the environment. The answer is yes. Quite simply, any manufacturing process harms the environment - so the claim is supported because no comparison is required.

Congressional health benefits
Before the Affordable Care Act, Congress and staffers got their health care through employer-provided insurance, the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program. During the ACA debate, the idea that members of Congress would not be subject to the exchanges became a big political issue. So, the final ""ACA"" (Obamacare) required lawmakers and staffers to get their insurance through the local health exchange, the District of Columbia’s small business health options program (SHOP) exchange.

For the 2017 plan year, there were 57 plan options in the gold tier on the DC SHOP. Members and staff have to choose at least the gold option to receive the employer contribution, which is figured at 72% of the weighted average of all FEHB plan premiums.  

Once a member or staffer is no longer in federal service, they have an option to enroll in an FEHB plan under Temporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC) that they pay for (like COBRA).

Want more details on the Congressional health benefits? This CRS Report has you covered.

Congressional retirement benefits
Up until 1984, federal employees (including Members of Congress) did not pay Social Security taxes or receive Social Security benefits but were instead covered by the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). Members elected after 1984 are covered by the Federal Employees’ Retirement System (FERS).

Like other federal employees, Congressional pensions are financed through employee and employer contributions. Members pay Social Security payroll taxes equal to 6.2% Social Security taxes and contribute to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF).

Members of Congress are eligible for a pension at age 62 (with at least five years of service), age 50 (with at least twenty years of service), or at any age (after 25 years of service). ""The amount of the pension depends on years of service and the average of the highest three years of
salary. By law, the starting amount of a Member’s ret		

Do members of members of congress gets free health care?		
Before the Affordable Care Act, senators and representatives used to receive health insurance through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program, which was similar to health insurance programs at large companies. That means that the employer (in this case, the U.S. government) makes a contribution toward the health insurance plan selected by the employee. Under the Affordable Care Act, the government still covers a portion of the costs but the plans have to be purchased on a D.C. exchange called D.C. Health Link.		

What Benefits Do Members Of Congress Get After They Leave Office?		
A sitting Member of Congress earns a salary of $174,000/year. That ends when he or she is no longer in office. But, depending on when the Member was elected, that person does receive a pension, access to a 401(k)-like retirement account and, in many cases Social Security benefits. Members of Congress started paying into Social Security in 1984. These benefits are generally the same as other federal employees would receive.

According to the Congressional Research Service, members are eligible for the pension at age 62 if they've served five years or more. (They are eligible at earlier ages with more years of service.)		

Does Congressional benefits include free health care ?		
No, It is not free, but it is generous compared to other private and not federal public employers. The percentage of premiums paid by the federal government
is calculated separately for individual, self plus one, and family coverage, but each uses the same
formula. According to the formula, the employer contribution is set at 72% of the weighted
average of all FEHB plan premiums, not to exceed 75% of any given plan’s premium.2

Is this an accurate statistic?		
No, It’s difficult to estimate the number of people who get food poisoning a year. It’s not always possible to prove someone got ill because of something they’d eaten, and they may not always go to a doctor or seek medical advice. As a result the estimates are broad.		

Where does the one in 6 figure come from?		
The figure of one in six for the US comes from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which estimates that “each year roughly 1 in 6 Americans (or 48 million people)” get sick as a result of foodborne diseases

The CDC told us this came from a paper published in 2011, but that the estimates are a “fairly accurate representation of the burden of [foodborne] diseases in the US.”		

Is the data between the two countries comparable?		
the data between the two countries isn’t comparable and varies considerably in how and when it was collected, and there are differences in the methodology behind the estimates.

The claims are misleading; the renumeration for Australia and New Zealand’s politicians is determined by independent statutory bodies, not the prime ministers; a salary freeze was indeed imposed on New Zealand’s politicians in 2018, but it was in place to establish a fairer system that determines pay increases for key office holders, not because of economic conditions.

The Nord Stream 2 infrastructure would enable Gazprom to cut Ukraine out of gas transit traffic, which could cost the country about $2 billion in transit fees (the equivalent of nearly 6 percent of its projected budget for 2018). Revenues aside, as Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki recently stated in Berlin, the real danger lies in the fact that Russia can launch a massive land offensive against Ukraine without fear of damaging Ukraine’s pipeline infrastructure and interrupting Gazprom’s exports to Western countries.		

why is Poland adverse to Russian energy		
The General Court next examines Poland’s argument that the 2016 decision breaches the principle 
of energy solidarity 8
in that it enables Gazprom and undertakings in the Gazprom group to redirect
additional volumes of gas onto the EU market by fully exploiting the capacities of the North Stream 
1 pipeline. Taking into account the lack of significant growth in demand for natural gas in central 
Europe, according to Poland, that would, as its only possible consequence, influence the 
conditions of supply and use of transmission services on the pipelines competing with OPAL. The 
General Court observes, in that regard, that that principle imposes not only obligations of mutual 
assistance where, for example following natural disasters or acts of terrorism, a Member State is in 
a critical or emergency situation as regards its gas supply, but also requires the European Union 
and the Member States to endeavour, in the exercise of their powers in the field of energy policy,
to avoid adopting measures likely to affect the interests of the EU and other Member States as 
regards security of supply, its economic and political viability, the diversification of supply or of 
sources of supply, and to do so in order to take account of their interdependence and de facto 
solidarity.

Were any workplace raids carried out when Obama was president of the U.S?		
Yes, But Government data on worksite enforcement operations shows that the number of individuals arrested on immigration law violation charges declined after Obama took office.		

What was the ICE doing under Obama's jurisdiction		
Under current Department of Homeland Security (DHS) guidance on immigration-relatedworksite enforcement, the agency uses available civil and administrative tools, including civilfines and debarment, to penalize and prevent unlawful employment. According to 2012 estimates,there are some 8.1 million unauthorized workers in the U.S. civilian labor force.DHS’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is responsible for immigration-relatedworksite enforcement, or enforcement of the prohibitions on unauthorized employment in Section274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The INA Section 274A provisions,sometimes referred to as employer sanctions, make it unlawful for an employer to knowinglyhire, recruit or refer for a fee, or continue to employ an alien who is not authorized to be soemployed. Today, ICE’s worksite enforcement program is focused primarily on cases that involvecritical infrastructure facilities and cases involving employers who commit “egregious” violationsof criminal statutes and engage in worker exploitation.Employers who violate INA prohibitions on the unlawful employment of aliens may be subject tocivil monetary penalties and/or criminal penalties. Criminal investigations may result indefendants being charged with crimes beyond unlawful employment and being subject to therelevant penalties for those violations		

How did the Obama administration tackle work place raids		
In April 2009, the Obama administration shifted the focus of workplace enforcement from arresting illegal workers to pressuring employers. The strategy marked an end to the President George W. Bush-era policy of conducting high-profile work-site raids that rounded up illegal immigrants for deportation.

The silent raids have ensnared thousands of businesses, mainly in the restaurant, agricultural and janitorial sectors. ICE agents collect and review hiring files, typically I-9 forms that verify eligibility to work in the U.S. Companies with unauthorized workers can face civil and criminal prosecution.

1769,Epidural injections given during childbirth are one of the worst and dangerous injections in the world resulting in chronic back pain.,"What are the side effects of Epidural injections ?		
Epidurals are very safe; serious complications are extremely rare. However, as with all medications and medical procedures, there are potential side effects:

    Decrease in blood pressure – The medication may lower your blood pressure, which may slow your baby’s heart rate. To make this less likely, you will be given extra fluids through a tube in your arm (IV), and you may need to lie on your side. Sometimes, your anesthesiologist will give you a medication to maintain your blood pressure.
    Sore back – Your lower back may be sore where the needle was inserted to deliver the medication. This soreness should last no more than a few days. There is no evidence that an epidural can cause permanent back pain.
    Headache – On rare occasions, the needle pierces the covering of the spinal cord, which can cause a headache that may last for a few days if left untreated. If this situation arises, discuss the treatment options with your anesthesiologist.		

Does epidural injections work on every pregnant woman?		
No answer could be found.		

What percentage of women use an epidural injection when giving birth in hospitals ?		
More than 50% of women giving birth at hospitals use epidural anesthesia.		

What is an epidural?		
Epidural anesthesia is regional anesthesia that blocks pain in a particular region of the body. The goal of an epidural is to provide analgesia, or pain relief, rather than anesthesia, which leads to a total lack of feeling. Epidurals block the nerve impulses from the lower spinal segments. This results in decreased sensation in the lower half of the body.		

How Long Does an Epidural Last?		
Once the catheter is in place, the anaesthetist can set up an epidural pump. The pump feeds the epidural solution into the catheter continuously, providing pain relief for as long as needed.

The type, amount and strength of the anaesthetic can be adjusted, as necessary. You might also be given the option of having control of the medication pump. This is called patient controlled analgesia. The amount of painkiller is still regulated, so you can’t accidentally overdose.

You can have the dose lowered for second stage pushing, but it takes some time for the pain relief and numbness to wear off, so if this is important to you, discuss it with your care provider early on.

What is the Hollywood blacklist based on?		
In October 1947, 10 members of the Hollywood film industry publicly denounced the tactics employed by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), an investigative committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, during its probe of alleged communist influence in the American motion picture business. These prominent screenwriters and directors, who became known as the Hollywood Ten, received jail sentences and were banned from working for the major Hollywood studios. Their defiant stands also placed them at center stage in a national debate over the controversial anti-communist crackdown that swept through the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Besides the Hollywood Ten, other members of the film industry with alleged communist ties were later banned from working for the big movie studios. The Hollywood blacklist came to an end in the 1960s.		

Were those who were blacklisted denied their right to work?		
The studios pledged never again to employ a known Communist or unrepentant fellow traveler. At the studios and the networks, hundreds of artists were shown the door — or had it shut in their faces. Johnston’s declaration marked the formal onset of the blacklist era, a two-decade-long purgatory during which political allegiances, real or suspected, determined employment opportunities in the entertainment industry.

A cohort life table shows the probability of a person from a given cohort dying at each age over the course of their lifetime. In this context, a cohort refers to a group of people with the same year of birth.

The cohort life table is based on age-specific probabilities of death, which are calculated using observed deaths (mortality) data from the cohort.		

How is life expectancy measured?		
A different way of looking at life expectancies is the use of period life expectancies, rather than the cohort life expectancies that we have looked at so far. Period life expectancies use mortality rates from a single year (or group of years) and assume that those rates apply throughout the remainder of a person's life. This means that any future changes to mortality rates would not be taken into account.		

Has life expectancy in the UK been falling?		
No, “The slowdown in life expectancy improvements in the UK has continued, as 2015 to 2017 saw the lowest improvements in life expectancy since the start of the series in 1980 to 1982. Some decreases in life expectancy at birth have been seen in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland whilst in England life expectancy has remained unchanged from 2014 to 2016. This slowing in improvements is reflected in the chances of surviving to age 90 years from birth, which has also seen virtually no improvement since 2012 to 2014.”

We define blackface as “black makeup worn (as by a performer in a minstrel show) in a caricature of the appearance of a black person,” and also as “a performer wearing such makeup.” This definition is accompanied by a usage note: “The wearing of blackface by white performers was, from the early 19th through the mid-20th centuries, a prominent feature of minstrel shows and similar forms of entertainment featuring exaggerated and inaccurate caricatures of black people. Its modern occurrence in imitation of such performers is considered deeply offensive.”

The Pill and cancer

While high dose Pills reduce your risk of cancer of the ovary and womb if used in the long term, it is not clear whether lower dose Pills like Femodene ED also provide the same protective effects. However, it also seems that taking the Pill slightly increases your risk of cancer of the cervix – although this may be due to having sex without a condom, rather than the Pill. All women should have regular smear tests.

If you have breast cancer, or have had it in the past, you should not take the Pill. The Pill slightly increases your risk of breast cancer. This risk goes up the longer you’re on the Pill, but returns to normal within about 10 years of stopping it. Because breast cancer is rare in women under the age of 40, the extra cases of breast cancer in current and recent Pill users is small. For example:

    Of 10,000 women who have never taken the Pill, about 16 will have breast cancer by the time they are 35 years old.
    Of 10,000 women who take the Pill for 5 years in their early twenties, about 17–18 will have breast cancer by the time they are 35 years old.
    Of 10,000 women who have never taken the Pill, about 100 will have breast cancer by the time they are 45 years old.
    Of 10,000 women who take the Pill for 5 years in their early thirties, about 110 will have breast cancer by the time they are 45 years old.

Your risk of breast cancer is higher:

    if you have a close relative (mother, sister or grandmother) who has had breast cancer
    if you are seriously overweight

    See a doctor as soon as possible if you notice any changes in your breasts, such as dimpling of the skin, changes in the nipple or any lumps you can see or feel.

Taking the Pill has also been linked to liver diseases, such as jaundice and non-cancer liver tumours, but this is rare. Very rarely, the Pill has also been linked with some forms of liver cancer in women who have taken it for a long time.		

What is the name of birth control pills that causes cancer ?		
The combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP), often referred to as the birth control pill or colloquially as ""the pill"", is a type of birth control that is designed to be taken orally by women. It includes a combination of an estrogen (usually ethinylestradiol) and a progestogen (specifically a progestin). When taken correctly, it alters the menstrual cycle to eliminate ovulation and prevent pregnancy.

They were first approved for contraceptive use in the United States in 1960, and are a very popular form of birth control. They are used by more than 100 million women worldwide and by almost 12 million females in the United States.[9] From 2015 to 2017, 12.6% of women aged 15–49 in the US reported using oral contraception, making it the second most common method of contraception in this age range with female sterilization being the most common method.[10] Use varies widely by country,[11] age, education, and marital status. For example, one third of women aged 16–49 in the United Kingdom currently use either the combined pill or progestogen-only pill (POP),[12][13] compared with less than 3% of women in Japan (as of 1950–2014).[14]

Combined oral contraceptives are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.[15] The pill was a catalyst for the sexual revolution.[16]

Emergency contraception pills are hormone-containing pills taken to give you a burst of hormonal contraception, which will likely prevent ovulation, fertilization, and/or implantation. Emergency contraception will not harm an already existing pregnancy.		

How does emergency contraception or the morning-after pill work?		
Plan B (A levonorgestrel morning-after pill) works like other birth control pills to prevent pregnancy. Plan B acts primarily by stopping the release of an egg from the ovary (ovulation). It may prevent the union of sperm and egg (fertilization). If fertilization does occur, Plan B may prevent a fertilized egg from attaching to the womb (implantation)."" In short, despite the confusion that opponents have fostered surrounding emergency contraception's mode of action, how the method works depends more on when during a woman's monthly menstrual cycle it is taken (and, specifically, whether she has ovulated) than on when she had sexual intercourse.

The Chester Bugle is a satirical news website, written by a bunch of nut jobs. It's not actual news, even though it may look like it to some people.

No answer could be found.		

Is there a legal mandate which would allow a US president to stop US firms from working in a different country?		
Yes, The International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 grants sweeping powers to the President to control economic transactions.		

How would the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 be triggered?		
The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) provides the President broad
authority to regulate a variety of economic transactions following a declaration of national
emergency.		

Can Congress overrule the triggering of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977?		
Yes, Congress may want to consider whether IEEPA
appropriately balances the need for swift action in a time of crisis with Congress’ duty to oversee executive action. Congress
may also want to consider IEEPA’s role in implementing its influence in U.S. foreign policy and national security decision-making.		

How many times has the US declared a national emergency against other countries?		
As of July 1, 2020, Presidents had declared 59 national emergencies invoking IEEPA, 33 of which are still ongoing.		

How easy is it for a US president to declare a national emergency?		
The process for accessing these powers is almost perfunctory. Under the National Emergencies Act of 1976, the president can declare a national emergency simply by signing his name to a proclamation, publishing it in the Federal Register, and transmitting it to Congress. The law does not define a national emergency or include any criteria for issuance.

What happened in the El Paso mass shooting?		
Police in El Paso, a large city on the Mexico-US border, first received reports of gunshots at 10:39 local time (16:39 GMT) on Saturday.

A gunman had opened fire with an assault-style rifle in a crowded Walmart on the city's east side. Nearby businesses were placed on lockdown and shoppers were evacuated.

The store is near a retail park, the Cielo Vista Mall, which is popular with El Paso residents as well as shoppers from just across the Mexican border.

In addition to the 22 fatalities, 24 people were injured in the shooting. Eight Mexican nationals were among the dead and the victims' ages range from 15 to 90.

Officers arrived on the scene within six minutes and the attacker surrendered after he was confronted by police outside the store.		

What happened in the Dayton mass shooting?		
Hours later, almost 1,600 miles away in Dayton, Ohio, shooting began at 01:07 local time (05:07 GMT) on Sunday in an area popular for its nightlife.

Security camera footage shows dozens of people racing through the doorway of the local Ned Peppers nightclub on E 5th Street. Nine people were killed and 27 were injured.

Just seconds later, the gunman is seen running towards the venue and being hit by police gunfire as he reaches the door. Police have confirmed they killed the gunman at the scene within 30 seconds of him opening fire.

Had the gunman made it through the door, Dayton Police Chief Richard Biehl said, the loss of life would have been ""catastrophic"".

The suspect, 24-year-old Connor Betts, used a .223-calibre assault rifle with high-capacity magazines that he had ordered legally from Texas. There was nothing in his history that would have stopped him from buying the gun legally, police said.

The problem with the argument blaming medications,however, is that though there has been a signicant increase in the use of psychiatric medications, there has not been a corresponding increase in violence. In fact, just the opposite has occurred. Violent crime has decreased dramatically.		

How many shooters were on psychiatric medications — or coming off them — at the time of their attacks?		
The following data is drawn from the sample of 48 shooters profiled in my book School Shooters: Understanding High School, College, and Adult Perpetrators. Out of 24 secondary school shooters, only two were taking medication at the time of their attacks: Eric Harris and Jeffrey Weise. Alvaro Castillo might have been, or he may have stopped his medication within three weeks of his attack and thus still have been coming off the drug. If we include him, then 12.5% of the sample was taking medications. Put differently, over 87% of the secondary school shooters were not on psychiatric medications at the time of their attacks. Furthermore, there is no evidence that medication made Harris, Weise, or Castillo manic or psychotic. The numbers are essentially the same for the college and adult shooters.

According to a Congressional Research Service report dated 18/03/2013:
There is no broadly agreed-to, specific conceptualization of this issue, so this report uses its own definition for public mass shootings. These are incidents occurring in relatively public places,
involving four or more deaths—not including the shooter(s)—and gunmen who select victims
somewhat indiscriminately. The violence in these cases is not a means to an end—the gunmen do
not pursue criminal profit or kill in the name of terrorist ideologies, for example.		

What is the definition of ""mass shooting"" in the US?		
Gun Violence Archive uses a purely statistical threshold to define mass shooting based ONLY on the numeric value of 4 or more shot or killed, not including the shooter.		

How does US compare to the rest of the world in connection with mass shootings?		
According to a research paper written by John R Lott, Crime Prevention Research Center dated  November 12, 2018:

The U.S. is well below the world average in terms of the number of mass public shootings, and the global increase over time has been much bigger than for the United States.

Over the 18 years from 1998 to 2015, our list contains 2,354 attacks and at least 4,880 shooters outside the United States and 53 attacks and 57 shooters within our country. By our count, the US makes up less than 1.15% of the mass public shooters, 1.49% of their murders, and 2.20% of their attacks. All these are much less than the US’s 4.6% share of the world population. Attacks in the US are not only less frequent than other countries, but they are also much less deadly on average.		

What does the updated version dated August 11, 2020 of this paper state?		
The U.S. is well below the world average in terms of the number of mass public shootings, and the global increase over time has been much bigger than for the United States.

Over the 20 years from 1998 to 2017, our list contains 2,772 attacks and at least 5,764 shooters outside the United States and 62 attacks and 66 shooters within our country. By our count, the US makes up less than 1.13% of the mass public shooters, 1.77% of their murders, and 2.19% of their attacks. All these are much less than the US’s 4.6% share of the world population. Attacks in the US are not only less frequent than other countries, they are also much less deadly on average. Out of the 101 countries where we have identified mass public shootings occurring, the United States ranks 66th in the per capita frequency of these attacks and 56th in the murder rate.		

What definition is used in this paper for the term ""mass public shootings""?		
The cases here meet FBI's traditional definition of mass public shootings.		

What are the recorded statistics of mass shootings in the US in 2015 according to the US Gun Violence Archive?		
Mass Shootings recorded as  ""Number of INCIDENTS reported and verified"" in 2015 were 335.		

What did the Gun Violence Archive record as the number of mass shootings in 2019?		
The number recorded in the archive was 417.		

How do other nations define ""mass shooting""?		
The Flemish Peace Institute studied mass shootings in Europe in which there were at least four deaths (not including the perpetrators) and which were not carried out in the domestic sphere or were the immediate result of purely criminal activities such as an armed robbery.		

Are the definitions of ""mass shooting"" from various sources/locations consistent?		
No, Different organisations will filter their data differently (excluding domestic crimes or gang violence for example) leading to variation in the definition of mass shooting.

The NYPD could have started those proceedings years ago. In fact, it did start that process well before the Justice Department closed its civil rights investigation this year with no charges. The NYPD’s delay had a material effect, because it meant more requirements for prosecutors seeking to prove Pantaleo’s culpability.

What is the Mueller Report?		
The report is a summation of the findings from the special counsel investigation. It is expected to contain the details of the investigation, from its interviews with key witnesses and other evidence amassed throughout the process and the Mueller team’s conclusions – or lack thereof.

In a letter to lawmakers, Attorney General William Barr said the report “sets forth the Special Counsel’s findings, analysis and the reasons for his conclusions.” 

Mueller was appointed in May 2017 shortly after Trump fired Comey. Mueller was authorized to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election, whether any Trump associates coordinated or colluded with the Russians, whether Trump obstructed the investigation and any other crimes that were uncovered during the investigation.		

Did Donald Trump act in good faith when being investigated?		
Trump consistently denied that he or anyone on his team colluded with Russia to interfere in the election, and he has rejected further the intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia attempted to interfere in the election at all, including while standing next to Russian President Vladimir Putin shortly after Mueller’s appointment. He likewise denied the possibility he had obstructed justice.

Throughout the process, Trump railed against Mueller and Mueller’s team, accusing them of political bias and maligning both the intelligence community and Justice Department more broadly.		

What did the Mueller report discover about Donald Trumps role in the Russian interference of the 2016 U.S presidential campaign?		
Our investigation found multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and obstruction investigations,” Mueller wrote. “The incidents were often carried out through one-on-one meetings in which the President sought to use his official power outside of usual channels. These actions ranged from efforts to remove the Special Counsel and to reverse the effect of the Attorney General’s recusal; to the attempted use of official power to limit the scope of the investigation; to direct and indirect contacts with witnesses with the potential to influence their testimony.

Mexican non-governmental organization (NGO) the Citizen's Council for Public Security and Criminal Justice (Consejo Ciudadano para la Seguridad Pública y la Justicia Penal – CCSPJP) has published its list of the world's 50 Most Violent Cities in 2015, which ranked Caracas number one.Since El Faro's Sala Negra was created five years ago, I have worked as a journalist who tries to understand violence indicators in El Salvador, and I like to compare them with what is happening in other countries in Latin America.

While international news agencies and prestigious media outlets elevate this Mexican NGO's list as absolute truth, we at Sala Negra dismissed it as a trusted source some two or three years ago. And we did it for one simple reason: in my opinion, the list's errors and superficiality are far too serious.

The ranking doesn't count deaths in war zones or cities with unavailable data.Thirty-four of the 50 worst cities were located in the region, including repeat murder capital of the world — San Pedro Sula, Honduras — which saw 187 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants in 2013 and is getting steadily worse. A full one-third of global homicides occur in Latin America even though the region has just 8% of the world's population, according to United Nations data.

Drug trafficking, gang wars, political instability, corruption, and poverty combine to cause the region's elevated violence.

US cities also made the list, led by Detroit at No. 24 and New Orleans at No. 26.

The former Soviet Union may have banned micro- wave ovens for a short period, but no countries ban them today.		

Is there any plans to ban microwave ovens in Japan?		
No answer could be found.		

Are microwave ovens harmful to humans?		
Microwave ovens produce electromagnetic radiation.

You may find this concerning due to radiation’s negative connotations. However, this is not the type of radiation associated with atomic bombs and nuclear disasters.

Microwave ovens produce non-ionizing radiation, which is like the radiation from your cell phone — though much stronger.

Keep in mind that light is also electromagnetic radiation, so clearly not all radiation is bad.

Microwave ovens have metal shields and metal screens over the window that prevent the radiation from leaving the oven, so there shouldn’t be any risk of harm.		

Are microwave ovens harmful to humans?

There is no evidence that they cause harm — and some evidence that they are even better than other cooking methods at preserving nutrients and preventing the formation of harmful compounds.

1951,Female soccer players in the U.S are earning less money than male players.,"How much does the U.S Female soccer players earn compared to USMNT?		
In March, every member of the U.S. women's team filed a lawsuit against the soccer federation for gender discrimination. It stipulates that currently, if each team played and won 20 exhibition games in a year, “female WNT players would earn a maximum of $99,000 or $4,950 per game, while similarly situated male MNT players would earn an average of $263,320 or $13,166 per game."" So the team is seeking equal treatment and pay, because as it stands, the women reportedly 38% of what their male counterparts make. As far as individual players' incomes, they can vary markedly based on sponsorships and star power. Goalie Ashlyn Harris told The New York Times that she expects to make “between $300,000 and $400,000” this year, and another player estimated $167,500. Alex Morgan is estimated to earn $1 million annually. But for players without endorsement deals and less celebrity status, the numbers can be a lot lower.Prior to the U.S. team's most recent landslide victory, Democratic presidential candidates Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren have long taken up the cause of equal pay in sports. The Paycheck Fairness Act, passed by House Democrats, would protect against gender discrimination, though it is currently stalled in the Senate. Notably, when asked by a reporter earlier this week if the women's team should be paid the same as the men, President Trump declined to respond.		

How much is Women's World Cup 2019 Prize Money ?		
The 2019 World Cup championship team will win $4 million, and the total prize money awarded to all teams during this summer's World Cup is roughly $30 million. Both figures are double what the women's World Cup paid out to teams during the 2015 tournament in Canada. But let's compare those figures with the men's World Cup: In 2018, World Cup champion France was awarded $38 million by FIFA for winning the tournament, which is more than what all of the 2019 women's World Cup teams get combined. The prize money overall for the men's 2018 World Cup in Russia came to a total of $400 million, or over 13 times more than the FIFA prize money for the women this summer. What's more, members of the USA women's team earned bonuses of $90,000 for reaching the quarterfinals in the 2019 World Cup. If the U.S. men's team had reached the same point in last year's World Cup, they would have gotten bonuses of $550,000. This is the case even though the U.S. women's team outearns the men's team in revenues. The main argument for why the men's World Cup prize money totals are so much bigger than the women's counterpart is that men's soccer has far more interest among fans — and far higher revenues overall around the globe. The women's World Cup 2015 in Canada reportedly brought in $73 million in revenues, including some $17 million in TV ads just in the U.S. Those are actually tiny numbers compared to the $6 billion in revenues FIFA raked in during the 2018 men's World Cup in Russia.		

How Much Money U.S. Women's National Team Players Make ?		
The U.S. women's national team fought for a raise, and got one in 2017, when players began receiving an undisclosed pay increase. Before then, members of the U.S. national team were paid ""a maximum of $4,950 per 'friendly,' or non-tournament, game that they won, while men’s national-team players earned an average of $13,166 for the same thing,"" according to The Atlantic. Yet even after the pay raise, America's female national team still makes significantly less than their male equivalents. This is the case even though the women have won three World Cups and four Olympic gold medals over the past two decades, compared to zero and zero for the U.S. men's team. Earlier this year, the U.S. women's team filed a lawsuit against U.S. Soccer, seeking better pay for women, who reportedly earn 38% of what their male counterparts make. Among other arguments U.S. Soccer attorneys have made to explain the gender pay differences are that the men's and women's national teams ""have separate collective bargaining agreements; and have separate budgets that take into account the different revenue that the teams generate."" While U.S. Soccer fights the women's national team lawsuit, sponsors have stepped up in the battle over equal pay. In early April, USWNT sponsor LUNA Bar made a donation that will give each member of the women's team $31,250 — which is the difference between the World Cup bonuses for America's men's and women's teams. Meanwhile, U.S. Soccer sponsor Visa says that under the terms of a new five-year deal more than 50% of its funding will go to the women's team, rather than a 50-50 split between men and women like in the past. And soccer branding titan Adidas says that it will pay equal bonuses to all of its sponsored players, male and female alike, for winning the World Cup. So how much money could U.S. women's national team players make if they win the World Cup 2019? It's difficult		

Are the female soccer players in the U.S are earning less money than male players ?		
Sometimes. When the female players have appeared to make about the same or more money, they’ve had to turn in consistently outstanding performances on the world stage. Even with those feats, earning the same amount as the men’s soccer players was near-impossible under the previous collective-bargaining agreement.

The new agreement has provisions that may reduce the difference in bonuses for friendly games and tournaments, but there is — without question and for whatever reasons — still a massive gap between men’s and women’s World Cup bonuses. Hence, since it is true that the women soccer players are paid less as they bring lesser revenue.

(When we looked at claims in 2016 from both sides on the law’s role in mass incarceration, we found the trend of increasing imprisonment began well before 1994, but experts told us the 1994 law exacerbated the issue.)

Biden was referring to the “U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America,” which began under Obama in fiscal year 2016 at a level of $750 million, according to a June 12 report by the Congressional Research Service, an arm of the Library of Congress. (See Table 5, page 13.)		

How much had the program decreased before Trump was elected?		
Appropriations for the program had already decreased to just under $685 million by fiscal year 2017, which began Oct. 1, 2016, before Trump was elected and nearly four months before he took office.		

How much further did it reduce during Trump's administration?		
From there, appropriations fell further to an estimated $527.6 million in the current fiscal year, according to the CRS report. That’s a reduction of just under 23 percent.

Trump’s budget request for fiscal 2020, which begins Oct. 1, calls for a further cut to $445 million — which would represent a cumulative reduction in annual appropriation levels of 35 percent since the last fiscal year that began under Obama.

Can medical debt lead to personal bankruptcy		
The fact that, according to a 2014 report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, about 20% of Americans have substantial medical debt yet in a given year less than 1% of Americans file for personal bankruptcy suggests that this assumption is problematic. Clearly, many people face medical debt but do not go bankrupt.

2037,The US-Iran nuclear deal pushed back a nuclear breakout by 10–20 years.,"What is the US-Iran nuclear deal?		
The Iran nuclear deal effectively shuts Iran’s pathways to nuclear weapons while preserving its legal right to civilian nuclear energy. The deal substantially lengthens the time Iran would need to enrich enough uranium for nuclear weapons, putting eyes on the program to detect any activity toward overt weaponization and drastically increasing the chance of detecting any so-called secret “sneakout.”		

What is the US-Iran nuclear deal?		
Known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, this deal:

• Cuts off all of Iran’s pathways to a nuclear weapon,
including a covert pathway

• Puts in place vigorous, intrusive, and unprecedented
transparency measures that are necessary to verify that
Iran cannot pursue a weapon

• Ensures sanctions can be snapped backinto place if Iran
violates the deal		

Is the Iran nuclear deal delaying a nuclear breakout?		
The deal extends the time Iran would need to produce an atomic bomb from two or
three months to at least one year, which would give the United States and its allies an
opportunity to react if the Iranians broke the agreement.		

Does the Iran nuclear deal limit Iran's ability to produce nuclear weapons?		
It puts strong, verifiable limits on Iran’s ability to develop a nuclear weapon for at least the next 10 to 15 years and is potentially one of the most consequential accords in recent diplomatic history, with the ability not just to keep
Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon but also to reshape Middle East politics.		

Does the Iran nuclear deal limit Iran's ability to produce nuclear weapons?		
Under these limits, “breakout time” at Natanz over the next
decade would be extended to roughly a year, from the current
estimated breakout time of 2 to 3 months.
4
 From year 11 to year
15, breakout time at Natanz will decline as Iran is permitted to
replace its first-generation centrifuges with limited numbers of
advanced models, although the restrictions on enriched uranium stocks and enrichment level continue through year 15.
Estimating breakout time during years 11 to 15 is difficult. The
number and type of advanced centrifuges that Iran is permitted
to deploy during this period is not public, and the performance
of advanced centrifuge models under development is uncertain.		

Will Iran be able to produce nuclear weapons once the limits are lifted?		
After 15 years, all physical constraints on enrichment imposed
by the agreement will be lifted. At that point, Iran could build an enrichment plant large enough to produce low-enriched uranium to fuel a nuclear power reactor within a matter of years.

Meanwhile the top 1% saw their income rise by 233%.		

Was Booker correct in saying that the private insurance overhead was 15 percent while Medicare’s was only at 2 percent ?		
It’s true that the most recent Trustees Report of the Medicare system puts total “administrative expenses” at $9.9 billion last year. That’s actually 1.3 percent of total Medicare expenditures for the year — even less than the 2 percent figure Booker cited. So far, so good. Our conclusion: Booker and others using this and similar claims have a point — Medicare does spend less on administration than private insurers. But it’s not so simple as they would have you believe.

Natanz during this period because detection would be swift and the risk of provoking a military attack would be high. Since all enrichment will be limited to Natanz for 15 years under the

2043,"Sen. Cory Booker claimed private insurance overhead was 15 percent, while Medicare’s was “only at 2 percent.”","What were Medicare's admin expenses as a percentage of total expenses in 2018?		
1.3%		

What were Medicare's admin expenses as a percentage of total expenses in 2018?		
he most recent Trustees Report of the Medicare system puts total “administrative expenses” at $9.9 billion last year. That’s actually 1.3 percent of total Medicare expenditures for the year — even less than the 2 percent figure Booker cited.		

How does the overhead charge for healthcare compare to the admin cost of healthcare?		
Comparing data for the public Medicare with private Medicare, we show that the administrative expenses percentage of benefits for the public system is much lower.
The definitions are incompatible and not reconcilable between the systems.
We expand the focus to more financial data. Per-member income and benefits are larger for the public Medicare and grew faster than Medicare Part C, reversing earlier trends. The public Medicare is not solvent in many years, whereas the insurers’ Medicare has an 85% loss ratio.		

Are there other reasons that these numbers are incomparable.		
Yes, Medicare beneficiaries are all age 65 or over, or disabled, and on average have much larger medical bills than the mostly under-65 population served by private health insurance. A 2006 study estimated that in 2003, the average medical cost for Medicare was $6,600 per person per year while the average medical cost for private health insurance (excluding out-of-pocket costs) was less than half that — $2,700 per person per year.

Yes, John L. Brownlee, United States Attorney for the Western District of Virginia, and Virginia
Attorney General Bob McDonnell announced today that The Purdue Frederick Company, Inc.,
along with its President, Chief Legal Officer, and former Chief Medical Officer have pleaded guilty to charges of misbranding Purdue’s addictive and highly abusable drug OxyContin.		

What was the reason for Purdue Pharma's legal action?		
The Purdue Frederick Company, Inc., and the three executives have
admitted that Purdue fraudulently marketed OxyContin by falsely claiming that OxyContin
was less addictive, less subject to abuse, and less likely to cause withdrawal symptoms than
other pain medications when there was no medical research to support these claims and
without Food and Drug Administration approval of these claims.

To address America’s opioid epidemic from the premise that there is a right to the highest attainable standard of health, that standard must be applied to the epidemic; To prevent addiction, prescribing fewer opioids for shorter periods at lower dosages works.		

Was the US Opioid epidemic that involved the misbranding of Oxycontin a Human Rights violation and was there denial of the victims' right to justice and redress.		
One prosecutor involved in the Purdue Pharma case said during a 2007 court hearing that pleas by the executives to misdemeanors — charges that did not even accuse them of wrongdoing — would send a message that drug industry officials faced being held to “a higher standard.” But the message it really sent was that the only real penalties companies paid for breaking the law were fines that essentially amounted to a cost of doing business. The Purdue Pharma case shows how the Justice Department contributed to this catastrophe by failing to hold drug company executives accountable to the same level of justice as street-level drug dealers.

2051,Russia is not using illegitimate sanctions against Georgia.,"Is Russia using illegitimate sanctions against Georgia?		
We have seen the Russian consumer-protection agency politicize trade and ban certain products when political relations with Russia deteriorate, not only in Georgia, but also in the Baltics, Moldova, Ukraine, and Central Asia,” Sergi Kapanadze, the Dean of the Caucasus School of Governance at the Caucasus University in Tbilisi wrote in a 2014 policy memo for the European Council on Foreign relations.		

What are the sanctions imposed by Russia against Georgia?		
After the Rose Revolution brought Saakashvili to power in 2004, Moscow soon began applying energy sanctions to the recalcitrant Georgian leader. As with other defiant ex-Soviet states, Georgia was subjected to massive gas price increases. From 2004 to 2006 the price demanded by Gazprom, the Russian state gas monopoly, increased by nearly 500 percent, from $50 to $235 per thousand cubic meters.19 Moscow tried to portray this as a ‘normal’ price increase, designed to bring Georgia in line with prices charged to Moscow's West European purchasers, which the Kremlin described as the “world market price.” Yet the political rationale was clear. First, price increases were targeted carefully to states which angered Moscow. Georgia, in fact, was treated the worst of any state—it was the first to be forced to pay full ‘Western’ prices, even ahead of Ukraine. Russia's most dramatic action, though, took place on January 22, 2006. Just days earlier it had stopped gas supplies to the Ukraine, allegedly over a pricing dispute. But it seemed that simply turning off the gas valves, even in midwinter, was not enough of a punishment for Georgia. Russia announced that both main gas lines to Georgia had been cut by bomb blasts, allegedly the work of Chechen separatists.23 Doubts were quickly raised. Why would Chechens target Georgia, a state which was at worst neutral in their dispute with Russia—and perhaps covertly a supporter, as Moscow alleged? Although it was never proven, many believed that Moscow had cut the lines deliberately, to weaken Saakashvili's government. Georgia suffered through a few days of closed schools and factories and freezing homes until gas service was restored.24		

What are the sanctions imposed by Russia against Georgia?		
As tensions rose with the new Saakashvili government, that is exactly what Moscow did. Georgian shipments were delayed by long ‘customs inspections’—a fatal measure for goods such as fresh fruit. The quality and safety of Georgian wine and mineral water was questioned. Russia's Chief Sanitary Inspector, Gennady Onishchenko, claimed that Georgian wine contained heavy metals and pesticides.33 In March, 2006, sales of Georgian wine were forbidden on ‘health’ grounds—a measure which remained in effect for over seven years—until, as we shall see, the election of a new President suddenly made Georgian wine ‘healthy’ again. Similarly, two major brands of Georgian mineral water were barred from the Russian marked in May, 2006 for “failing to meet water purity standards.”34 Banning imports on ‘health’ grounds has become a favorite tactic of the Kremlin, since these actions seem superficially plausible compared to open embargos.35

famously defined political legitimacy as the de facto ability of a political regime to
secure acceptance based on belief (‘Legitimita¨tsglaube’) as opposed to securing compliance based on coercion alone.6 In ‘Reply to Habermas’ Rawls dismisses the sociological
or descriptive concept of political legitimacy associated with Weber as insufficient.7 Not
because he thinks that Weber is wrong to focus on de facto acceptance of political
authority, but because Rawls thinks that any sufficient definition of legitimacy would

have to acknowledge that there must be a benchmark of appropriate acceptance, or a
benchmark for when our belief that something is legitimate is appropriate. A full examination of political legitimacy must also ask whether
the agent who made the decision is authorized to make the decision, and whether the
decision has been made in accordance with established and recognized procedures that
are themselves appropriately authorized and sufficiently just.		

What's meant by illigitimate sanctions?		
Imposed without U.N. approval and contrary to WTO rules, international economic sanctions are no longer the exception, but a “new norm,” as Fyodor Lukyanov, editor-in-chief of this journal, argues. Sanctions against Russia were extended in 2015. And almost everyone even in Russia has forgotten that the sanctions are illegitimate, as if everyone has agreed that this is inevitable. Following this bad example Russia has introduced sanctions against Turkey. Retaliation, perhaps even much more severe, had to follow. But sanctions are in the gray area. And as a rule, they are ineffective or even counterproductive.

2052,Ninety percent of the people applying for asylum never show up for their immigration court hearing in the months ahead.,"What percentage of migrants show up to immigration court hearings, in the United States?		
Data show that 96 percent of asylum applicants show up to all their immigration court hearings.		

Does the United States government provide defensive asylum seekers with appointed immigration lawyers?		
Right to due process

What the law says: The Fifth Amendment states that “no person … shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”

The issue of due process is at the heart of many immigration cases, including Reno v. Flores, the 1993 Supreme Court case that has returned to the spotlight with the surge in family separations. The case led to an agreement requiring the government to release children to their parents, a relative or a licensed program within 20 days.

In the ruling, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote “it is well established that the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings.”

How it works in practice: Immigrants have the right to due process. But in reality, says, Andrew Arthur, a resident fellow in law and policy at the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, “courts of law run the gamut.”

In some cases, immigrants are not granted a hearing at all. When asked about the president’s tweet, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders pointed to the process of “expedited removal,” which was created by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996.

“Just because you don’t see a judge doesn’t mean you aren’t receiving due process,” Sanders said.

Under the expedited removal process, immigrants who have been in the country illegally for less than two years and are apprehended within 100 miles of the border can be deported almost immediately without going through a court hearing.

The exception is asylum seekers, who must be granted a hearing.

Those who are not processed through expedited removal have the right to due process in an immigration court, where the main goal is to decide whether a person has a legal claim to remain in the U.S.

“In immigration court, you have very few rights,” said John Gihon, an immigration attorney who spent six years as a prosecutor for U.S. Immigration and Cust

Yes, The Russian mercenaries fighting in Syria say they are not in the country for the money or to help Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Early last month, an unknown number of Russian mercenaries -- some reports say a dozen, others as many as 200 -- were killed by U.S. air strikes during fighting in Syria. The men were hired by a private military contracting firm called ChVK Vagner, which has been sending Russians to fight in Syria since 2015.		

Is ChVK Vagner sponsored by Russia?		
Mark Galeotti, a researcher with the Institute of International Relations in Prague, has written extensively on the topic of Wagner and Russia’s use of mercenaries as a potentially deniable asset. According to him, Wagner cannot be considered a legitimate private military company.

“I tend to call Wagner a pseudo-mercenary outfit because it is somewhere in between,” Galeotti told Polygraph.info. “Given that it seems largely bankrolled through Evro Polis [a company owned by Prigozhin], and it has a contract with the Syrian government worth 25% of the output of any gas and oil fields it recovers, there is clearly some truly mercenary aspect, even if much of the time it is working for the Russian command cell in Damascus.”

But while he acknowledges a possible change in Wagner’s ownership, Galeotti agreed that the organization was undoubtedly tied to the Russian state, at least in the beginning: “I don't think there is any question they were originally a state-sponsored op, is there?”

And given the fact that wounded fighters still appear to be receiving treatment at Russian military hospitals, possibly arriving on Russian military transport aircraft, it appears that Russian authorities know far more about Wagner and its activities than they have so far admitted in public.		

Have any Russian mercenaries received state medals of the type usually awarded to military personnel?		
Yes, According to Fontanka, Troshev (Wagners executive director) was awarded the Hero of Russia honor for assisting in the capture of Palmyra. Bogatov also reportedly won this title. Kuznetsov and Uktin have reportedly won the Order of Courage four times.

Alexander E.M. Hess, Michael Sauter  |  24/7 Wall Street

More than half of the world's population believes corruption in the public sector is a very serious problem. Liberia and Mongolia are the two most corrupt countries in the world, according to a recent study. In both countries, 86% of residents believe corruption in the public sector is a very serious problem. Residents in the vast majority of countries around the world believe corruption has only gotten worse in the past two years.

Anti-corruption nonprofit Transparency International has released its 2013 Global Corruption Barometer, which surveyed residents in 107 countries. The world's corrupt nations differ in many ways. Four are located in Africa, three in Latin America and two in Asia. These nations also vary considerably in size and population. Mongolia has just 3.2 million residents, while Mexico, Nigeria and Russia are three of the largest countries on the globe, each with more than 100 million people. Based on the percentage of surveyed residents that reported corruption in the public sector is a very serious problem, these are the world's most corrupt nations

Is Nigeria facing security challenges		
FOR some time now, the problem of insecurity which used to be one of the lowest in the hierarchy of social problems facing this country seems to have assumed alarming proportions since the end of the Nigerian civil war which ended in 1970.		

What has the Nigerian government done about the security challenges		
The insurgency has attracted the substantial deployment of the nation’s defense and intelligence establishments, as the Joint Task Force (JTF), which is comprised of the police and army, has been deployed in ten states in the north. Also, at border points, there has been tightened security, strict searches, and the deportation of illegal aliens.		

What has the Nigerian government done about the security challenges		
For instance, the Borno State government donated 10 armoured vehicles to the police, apparently to enable the Force to effectively combat the sect. In the 2012 budget, the government allocated a staggering $5.947 billion to defence and national security, translating to ₦921.91billion. This figure represents 20 per cent of the total budget and the highest allocation ever for defence and security in the history of the country. This also makes Nigeria the biggest spender on defence and security in Africa. The 2012 allocation is also a marked difference from the ₦233 billion in 2009, ₦264billion in 2010, and ₦348 billion in 2011.[19] The government has also ensured that Nigerian security agents receive up to the minute training in counter-terrorism, and every other capacity building initiative available in the world today for combating terrorism. This training has been continuous, taking place both in and outside the country. There has been speculation that some 300 Nigerian soldiers were sent to the United States to receive counter-insurgency, counter-terrorism and bomb-disposal training specifically aimed at fighting BH. However, Nigerian Army sources were reported as denying this. US officials would not comment on whether such activities were linked to BH.[20]		

Has the response of the government caused some change in the security challenge		
On Friday night an armed gang killed at least 34 people in the north-western state of Zamfara, which has been at the centre of a wave of attacks by bandits since the beginning of the year.

The Boko Haram insurgency has been terrorising people in the north-east for the past decade, and has been the main area of focus for Nigeria's armed forces.

But the triple suicide bombings in Borno on Sunday reflect just how complex the security challenges are.

The government has said that Boko Haram and the rival Islamic State of West Africa Province (Iswap) group are on their last legs. But both the military and population of the north-east continue to suffer regular attacks.

If only flows related to drug trafficking and other
transnational organized crime activities were considered, related proceeds would have been equivalent to
around US$650 billion per year in the first decade
of the new millennium, equivalent to 1.5% of global
GDP or US$870 billion in 2009 assuming that the
proportions remained unchanged. The funds available
for laundering through the financial system would
have been equivalent to some 1% of global GDP or
US$580 billion in 2009.

American groups, notably groups from Colombia (most
of the US$3.3 bn in profits generated in shipping the
cocaine to Mexico), followed by profits made by Mexican drug cartels (US$2 bn for shipping the cocaine
across the border to the USA; far more money is then
made by the Mexican drug cartels within the United
States in trafficking the cocaine to the various wholesalers and retailers).

This year millions of school children around the world will benefit from D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education), the highly acclaimed program that gives kids the skills they need to avoid involvement in drugs, gangs, and violence.

D.A.R.E. was founded in 1983 and has proven so successful that it has been implemented in thousands of schools throughout the United States and many other countries.

D.A.R.E. is a police officer-led series of classroom lessons that teaches children from kindergarten through 12th grade how to resist peer pressure and live productive drug and violence-free lives.		

What is a gateway drug?		
A gateway drug is a drug that opens the door to the use of other, harder drugs. Gateway drugs are typically inexpensive and readily available.

Now, that prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, says he was fired because he was pursuing Zlochevsky and Burisma. “I didn’t get the hints that we should stop the investigation of Burisma wrongdoing,” he said in an interview published this week, in which he also accuses Biden of pursuing “personal interests” in Ukraine and recruiting Ukrainian officials to protect them — charges Biden denies. Shokin’s claims are highly questionable. The illegal enrichment and money laundering investigation against Zlochevsky was started in August 2014 at the request of Shokin’s deputy, Vitaly Kasko. He had a strained relationship with his boss, and resigned in early 2016, two months before Shokin’s firing. Shokin didn’t actually lead the Zlochevsky investigation, so his removal wasn’t necessary to stop it. Besides, Kasko denies there was any U.S. pressure to end the investigation: He told Bloomberg News that the case had been dormant for a while when Shokin was fired.

The fund was announced in late 2013 — days after Hunter Biden and one of his daughters flew to China from Japan aboard Air Force Two with the vice president, who was in the midst of a diplomatic mission intended to calm rising tensions in the region. During the trip, Vice President Biden warned Chinese leaders not to use fighter jets to enforce an air defense zone created by Beijing over contested waters.

The conservative author Peter Schweizer has suggested that Hunter Biden used the trip to secure a deal with the Bank of China — a suggestion that has been echoed by Mr. Trump’s allies in the conservative news media.

Tariffs are a tax paid by American companies and consumers — not by the foreign governments targeted by the tariffs.		

How much did the Trump’s tariffs really cost Americans?		
If American technology companies cannot export to China, they would only create next competitors there, while losing access to a huge market.		

Did More Trump Tariffs Hamper China’s Development		
It is widely expected that these tariffs have thus far added more than one or two billion dollars in fiscal revenue to US government coffers. President Trump is complacent and self-congratulatory. However, the 10% tariff increase from the previous round seems to have been paid by American companies and consumers! US importers must see their profits eroded by tariffs if they do not directly pass these costs onto US companies downstream. A study by a group of economists from Princeton, Columbia, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimates that US companies have suffered a loss of $1.4 billion due to tariffs, while American consumers have footed the bill for more than $3 billion. Another study by another group of economists from the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation argues that the US-China trade war has cost the American economy $6.4 billion, equivalent to 0.03% of GDP. It seems unwise to let American companies and consumers take such large losses for such little increase in fiscal revenue.

In 1953 Paul Fisher invented the ""Universal Refill"" which could be used in most pens. Not content, Paul continued to work on making a better refill. After much experimentation he perfected a refill using thixotropic ink-semisolid until the shearing action of the rolling ball liquefied it-that would flow only when needed. The cartridge was pressurized with nitrogen so that it didn't rely on gravity to make it work. It was dependable in freezing cold and desert heat. It could also write underwater and upside down. The trick was to have the ink flow when you wanted it to, and not to flow the rest of the time, a problem Fisher solved. Fisher's development couldn't have come at a more opportune time. The space race was on, and the astronauts involved in the Mercury and Gemini missions had been using pencils to take notes in space since standard ball points did not work in zero gravity. The Fisher cartridge did work in the weightlessness of outer space and the astronauts, beginning with the October, 1968 Apollo 7 mission began using the Fisher AG-7 Space Pen and cartridge developed in 1966.

President Trump's initial round of tariffs led China to strike back and stop purchasing from the United States.		

What tariff did President Trump impose on China?		
So far, the US has slapped tariffs on US$550 billion worth of Chinese products.		

How will U.S. farmers be affected by the tariffs imposed on China by the United States?		
U.S. farmers and
ranchers have a strong interest in maintaining and
expanding export markets. Because of the broad scope of
farm products subject to the retaliatory tariffs from China
and other countries and the importance of some of the
markets involved, many farmers and ranchers are likely to
experience some negative effects, such as lost market
opportunities and potentially lower prices for their products.
While the Administration has released the trade aid package
to mitigate short-term losses to farmers and ranchers, it is
not designed to address potential longer-term negative
consequences, such as lower commodity prices and reduced
farm income from lost export sales.

2201,US President Donald Trump says four hundred miles of wall are getting built along the US-Mexico border.,"How many miles of border wall did Trump build?		
Officials say the construction starting in February is only part of the picture. Funding from fiscal year 2018, they say, also covers the cost of building 70 more miles of barriers – about 57 miles of which is replacement fencing.

And if the Trump administration’s proposal for $5.7 billion more for a border wall is approved, officials say they’ll be able to build 234 miles of new and replacement barriers – about 100 miles of which will cover parts of the border that didn’t have a barrier before.

But given that a partial government shutdown over the wall is already in its fifth week, whether that work will happen – and exactly what will happen next – is anybody’s guess.		

Is there a construction of  four hundred miles of wall by Trump on the  Mexico border ?		
A few prototypes were built in 2017, and over 100 miles of existing barriers have been, or are slated to be, repaired or replaced.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection said about 205 miles of new and replacement barriers have been funded since January 2017, and as of May 23, work had been completed on 42 miles of replacement fencing in California, Texas and Arizona.

A few prototypes with different designs were built in San Diego in 2017 and tested, but they have been demolished to make way for fencing. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has said the prototypes could “inform future border wall design standards in some capacity.”		

How much did Trump's border wall cost?		
President Donald Trump’s “wall” along the U.S.-Mexico border would be a series of fences and walls that would cost as much as $21.6 billion, and take more than three years to construct, based on a U.S. Department of Homeland Security internal report seen by Reuters on Thursday.

Where is Trump's border wall being built?		
If you consider the barrier projects built recently to be ""border walls,"" here are some of the locations: 

In April, the Border Patrol began construction of a ""border wall"" near El Paso at Santa Teresa, N.M. During a press conference, Aaron Hull, Chief Patrol Agent of the U.S. Border Patrol in El Paso sector, mostly referred to the project as the wall, sometimes calling it ""fence"" but quickly correcting himself. Hull said the metal barrier was the same design as others from the 2006 Secure Fence Act. The new barrier replaced existing metal posts which were designed only to block vehicles. 
In September, the Border Patrol announced construction of ""a new 4-mile section of bollard wall"" in the historic Chihuahuita neighborhood in El Paso. The new bollards replaced existing chain-link fencing.
In October, border officials marked the completion of 2 miles of barriers near Calexico, Calif. Crews had replaced older metal fencing with new, 30-foot steel bollards, a project identified as a priority and funded under President Barack Obama.
In November, Customs and Border Protection officials announced a contract for about 6 miles of ""wall system"" in the Rio Grande Valley. The project is supposed to include a concrete levee wall ""to the height of the existing levee"" with 18-foot bollards on top. That barrier is not being built yet; it's set to be started in February.
None of those barriers look like the wall prototypes built near San Diego, which Trump visited and praised earlier this year.

2261,Bumblebee has officially been added to the ever-growing list of endangered species,"Is the bumblebee an endangered species?		
Yes, On January 11, 2017, the Fish and Wildlife Service published a rule to list the rusty patched bumble bee (Bombus affinis), a species that occurs in the eastern and Midwestern United States and Ontario, Canada, as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). The rule was to be effective on February 10, 2017.		

When is a species considered as endangered?		
The conservation status of a species indicates the likelihood that it will become extinct. Multiple factors are considered when assessing the status of a species; e.g., such statistics as the number remaining, the overall increase or decrease in the population over time, breeding success rates, or known threats.[4] The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is the best-known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system.[5]

Over 50% of the world's species are estimated to be at risk of extinction.[6] Internationally, 195 countries have signed an accord to create Biodiversity Action Plans that will protect endangered and other threatened species. In the United States, such plans are usually called Species Recovery Plans.		

What role do bees play in the ecosystem?		
More than 75 percent of the world's food crops rely to some extent on pollination for yield and quality. The absence of bees and other pollinators would wipe out coffee, apples, almonds, tomatoes and cocoa, to name just a few of the crops that rely on pollination.
 
""Each one of us has an individual responsibility towards protecting bees and we should all make pollinator-friendly choices. Even growing flowers at home to feed bees contributes to this effort,"" Graziano da Silva said.

Pollinators, such as bees, wild bees, birds, bats, butterflies and beetles fly, hop and crawl over flowers to help plants fertilize. Pollinator numbers and diversity have declined in the past decades, and evidence indicates that the decline is primarily a consequence of human activities including climate change which can disrupt flowering seasons.		

What is the endangered species act?		
Under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 in the United States, species may be listed as ""endangered"" or ""threatened"". The Salt Creek tiger beetle (Cicindela nevadica lincolniana) is an example of an endangered subspecies protected under the ESA. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, as well as the National Marine Fisheries Service are held responsible for classifying and protecting endangered species. They are also responsible for adding a particular species to the list, which can be a long, controversial process		

why was bumblebee added to the list of endangered species?		
“The rusty-patched bumblebee (Bombus affinis), once a common sight, is “now balancing precariously on the brink of extinction,” according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Once thriving in 28 states and the District of Columbia, but over the past two decades, the bee’s population has plummeted nearly 90 percent.

“We are ready to explain to any Ukrainian citizen that Russia is not occupying any Ukrainian territories and generally there can be no talk about that,"" the Kremlin spokesman said.		

Has Putin/Russia said more than once that for settling the conflict in Donbass the most important thing is not dialogue with Moscow, because Moscow is not a party to this conflict. It is an intra-Ukrainian conflict and it is up to the Ukrainians to settle it, if they talk to each other.""		
The statements of Dzhabarov and Podlesny both echo the official position of the Russian government, which has consistently insisted it is not a party to the conflict in the Donbas region of Ukraine		

Did Russia trigger the Ukrainian invasion of Donbass?		
Russian national Igor Strelkov, a former commander of pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine, has claimed personal responsibility for unleashing the conflict in which 4,300 people have been killed since April.

""I was the one who pulled the trigger of this war,"" Strelkov said in an interview published Thursday with Russia's Zavtra newspaper, which espouses imperialist views.

""If our unit hadn't crossed the border, everything would have fizzled out — like in [the Ukrainian city of] Kharkiv, like in Odessa,"" Strelkov, who uses that nom-de-guerre meaning ""Shooter"" to replace his last name Girkin, was quoted as saying.		

Has Russia denied being a party to the conflict in eastern Ukraine?		
Yes, Russia says no proof it sent troops, arms to east Ukraine.		

What kinds of evidence have been discovered in connection with Russia's involvement in eastern Ukraine?		
One obvious sign to look for is equipment that’s either exclusively used by Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, or has not ever been in manufactured or service in Ukraine. The modernized T-72B3 main battle tank has been an example of military equipment that is out of place in a conflict where Russian government actively denies military involvement.		

What kinds of evidence have been discovered in connection with Russia's involvement in eastern Ukraine?		
A Dutch-led international criminal investigation has concluded that the Buk missile that shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine in 2014 came from Russia's 53rd Antiaircraft Missile Brigade.

The Joint Investigative Team (JIT), comprising authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands, and Ukraine, made the announcement at a press conference on May 24 in Utrecht, the Netherlands.

MH17 was shot down over the conflict zone in Ukraine's Donetsk region on July 17, 2014, killing all 298 people on board.

The JIT ""has come to the conclusion that the Buk-TELAR that shot down MH17 came from the 53rd Antiaircraft Missile Brigade based in Kursk in Russia,"" top Dutch investigator Wilbert Paulissen told reporters. ""The 53rd Brigade is part of Russia's armed forces.""		

Is this claim a quote verification?		
No, The research for this claim is about whether Russia (Moscow) played a role in the Donbass conflict.

Are there plenty of vehicles that have a high towing capacity?		
Electric motors are also increasingly being used in shipping, again because of their ability to push large loads.

For over a decade electric motors have been used in mining trucks, sometimes with a capacity greater than 100 tonnes, due to their powerful, instant torque and ability to pull large loads at slow speeds.

First, he said, secondary education is not fully compulsory, as no law forced parents to ensure their children go to high school. It’s also not completely free. There are still direct costs such as for uniforms, transport and food. And the opportunity cost – the loss of possible income and domestic labour provided by children – is not considered.

What is the cause of the gradual rise on the Kenyatta's universal access to basic education agenda,    in 2019 ?		
The rise from 83.1% to 93.14% can be attributed to the free-day high school subsidy, and the work of provincial administration – chiefs and their assistants – to ensure all students who sit their final primary school exam get into secondary school.

Dr John Mugo, who has researched education in Kenya, said that while the transition rate had risen, it was unlikely to have reached 100%.

First, he said, secondary education is not fully compulsory, as no law forced parents to ensure their children go to high school. It’s also not completely free. There are still direct costs such as for uniforms, transport and food. And the opportunity cost – the loss of possible income and domestic labour provided by children – is not considered.

What is the definition of economic growth?		
Economic growth describes an increase in the quantity and quality of the economic goods and services that a society produces and consumes.		

How is economic growth measured?		
...it is extremely difficult to measure it. Growth is often measured as an increase in household income or inflation-adjusted GDP.

Income measures are merely one way to understand the economic inequality between countries and the changing prosperity over time. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of an economy is a measure of total production. More precisely, it is the monetary value of all final goods and services produced within a country or region in a specific time period. Comparisons over time and across borders are complicated by price, quality and currency differences.		

What are the basic indicators of economic activity?		
Measuring economic activity in a country or region provides insights into the economic well-being of its residents.

Gross Domestic Product (GDP), a widely used indicator, refers to the total gross value added by all resident producers in the economy. Growth in the economy is measured by the change in GDP at constant price. Many WDI indicators use GDP or GDP per capita as a denominator to enable cross-country comparisons of socioeconomic and other data.

Also widely used in assessing a country’s wealth and capacity to provide for its people is  Gross National Income (GNI) per capita - the sum of total domestic and foreign value added claimed by residents divided by total population.		

What was the average GDP growth in Kenya over the referenced years?		
The average GDP growth in Kenya over the referenced years was 4.36%.

Why was there a visa restriction on Nigerians ?		
Last month, the government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) imposed visa restrictions on Nigerians; according to the new policy, only Nigerians who are 40 years and above can travel to the UAE for business, tourism or any other private visit.

Before now, young Nigerians troop to UAE, particularly Dubai for different purposes.
Some go their to relax; some travel there just because they want to have their previously-unstamped international passports stamped; some travel there for business, among others. It is even not uncommon to find a group of friends fixing Dubai as the destination of their next social gathering.

Our politicians also have choice properties in this Arab state, but with the new immigration policy, only people who are 40 years and above can visit the UAE now, although the authorities gave certain conditions for people who are less than 40 years old who want to visit.

When I first heard of this new policy, I knew Nigerians have ‘spoilt’ this Arab country as well.
In 1988, I was travelling to India and had a stop-over in Dubai; the place was nothing to write home at that time, but now, less than 30 years later, Nigerians of all ages troop to Dubai for different purposes. It is just so unfortunate that while we have regressed, they have progressed.

Why have our leaders chosen to enrich themselves only at the expense of the people?; Why have we failed to develop? Where are all the money we have made selling oil, and yet cannot boast more than $30billion in foreign reserves?

We will continue to be treated with disdain in other parts of the world if we don’t develop our country.
Other countries will never respect us if we cant live in our country, and instead prefer to travel for greener pastures outside.
It is so painful today seeing Nigerians in even less-developed countries ekeing out a living.
I hope we can wake up on time before we experience more foreign insults.

how is a negative blue slip interpreted		
If a negative blue slip is received, the chairman may take the following actions
on the nominee: (1) stop all committee proceedings; (2) move forward but give added
weight to the unfavorable review; or (3) proceed without notice of the negative
review. Since the late 1970s, the committee has generally used the latter two actions
when dealing with a negative blue slip

2393,Eight professionals leave South Africa for every one that comes in.,"How accurate are statistics for professionals leaving South Africa?		
The focus of this chapter is on emigration of South Africans to other countries for the period 2006
to 2016. Measuring emigration remains a challenge as many emigrants do not declare their
departure to authorities of their countries and most countries have no working mechanisms to
oblige migrants to declare their departure. 

...result indicators such as net migration cannot be derived using this
information.		

Why is it difficult for accurate figures to be published?		
Limitations of this chapter include the fact that questions on citizenship and country of birth did not
form part of the profile of emigrants, hence it cannot be established with certainty that these
emigrants are South African nationals. Furthermore an undercount is highly possible since the
count is limited to those individuals who still have family members remaining in the country. As a
result if the whole family emigrated then such statistics could not be collected.		

Have passport barcodes of South Africans leaving or arriving home been scanned since 2003?		
No, South African departures and arrivals are no longer required to have passport barcodes scanned at the
ports of entry and exit; therefore, statistics on their departure and arrival are no longer available. Moreover those
departing through the three international airports are no longer required to complete departure forms. This is due
to the implementation of the Immigration Act, 2002 (Act No. 13 of 2002) by the Department of Home Affairs as
from April 2003.		

What does the media report is the estimate of emigration from South Africa?		
17 Jan 2019:

The most recent figures on emigration come from Stats SA’s Community Survey 2016, a large-scale survey conducted between censuses.
The survey showed that 97 460 South Africans had moved abroad since 2006. The bulk of them were between the ages of 25 and 44.

No answer could be found.

2394,President Donald Trump wants to abolish the pre-existing conditions protections within the U.S Affordable Care Act (ACA).,"Did President Donald Trump tried  to abolish the pre-existing conditions protections within the U.S Affordable Care Act (ACA) ?		
- Love it or loathe it, the United States is headed for four years of drastic policy changes under a Donald Trump administration, giving lawmakers another good chance to repeal, replace, or revise the Affordable Care Act.

The landmark healthcare legislation was the centerpiece of one of the most contentious campaigns in American history.  Staring down anticipated premium hikes of up to 25 percent on the public health insurance exchanges, millions of concerned citizens voted for the candidate they felt was most likely to make positive changes to a system that has never quite managed to address their needs.

The impact of a Republican Congressional majority, a Republican President, and a vacant seat on a Supreme Court that already struck down one of the ACA’s major provisions is as of yet unknown, but a conservative twist to our national drama will certainly bring the future of the healthcare coverage framework into question.

For healthcare provider organizations, the plot will thicken even further.  Thanks to provisions that require payers to cover patients with preexisting conditions and adhere to premium caps that have reduced their profitability, the ACA has incentivized a quick shift towards value-based care. 

Eager to trim costs, pay for fewer services, and attract as many patients as possible in a competitive and confusing marketplace, payers have incentivized providers to abandon the traditional fee-for-service reimbursement structure and look to population health management strategies as a way to stem the financial bleeding.

Will significant changes to the Affordable Care Act free up payers to return to more lucrative business practices, or will commercial insurers, Medicare, and Medicaid stay the course?

How can healthcare providers position themselves for success in what will undoubtedly be another turbulent episode in the healthcare saga, and what are the nation’s options for developing a new path forward while still delivering the best possible care		

What was Trump proposing regarding pre-existing conditions?		
The American Health Care Act, a bill proposed by House Republicans, required insurance companies to offer coverage regardless of preexisting conditions; however, they could charge more in certain instances.		

How does this affect those with medical conditions?		
the AHCA would have required insurers on the individual market to charge 30 percent higher premiums for one year, regardless of health status, to those who didn’t have continuous coverage, defined as a 63-day lapse over the previous 12 months. Plus, states could obtain a waiver that would allow insurers to charge even higher premiums to those with preexisting conditions who didn’t maintain continuous coverage.		

Does this affect everyone with pre-existing conditions?		
No, We don’t know what a future GOP replacement plan might stipulate. Sanders said those with cancer, heart disease or diabetes would pay more under Trump’s plan, but in the GOP plans put forth so far, not everyone with a preexisting condition would pay higher premiums. As we’ve explained, insurers could only price plans based on health status under certain conditions. However, the 2017 bills didn’t offer the same level of protections as the ACA.

He asked the federal courts to find the ACA unconstitutional and nullify the entire law		

Does trump plan to offer a replacement if the ACA is removed?		
They would plan to offer an unspecified alternative at a later date should ACA be removed.		

Where does the 32 million figure come from?		
The 32 million figure is based on a Congressional Budget Office estimate of the impact of the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act of 2017, which would have repealed the ACA altogether and replaced it with an unnamed replacement at a later date. According to the CBO, the plan would increase the number of uninsured by 32 million individuals over ten years.		

Why would the number of uninsured people increase?		
In the nongroup market, some people would choose not to have insurance partly because
they choose to be covered by insurance under current law to avoid paying the penalty.
And, under this legislation, without the mandate penalty, some people would forgo
insurance in response to the higher premiums that CBO and JCT project would be
charged. Insurers would still be required to provide coverage to any applicant, and they
would not be able to vary premiums to reflect enrollees’ health status or to limit coverage
of preexisting medical conditions.		

Would young adults up to the age of 26 be able to stay on their parents' insurance plans under the GOP?		
Yes, The bills do not change this provision of the ACA.

The food dollar series measures annual expenditures by U.S. consumers on domestically produced food.		

What was the farmers share of the food dollar in the 1970-1980 period ?		
A 2015 Congressional Research Service report, combining several data sets, indicates that the farm share was about 37 cents in the 1970-1980 period		

What is the current farmers share of the food dollar?		
14.6 cents however Under this metric, farm production receives only 7.8 cents of the dollar. The gap between 14.6 cents and 7.8 cents indicates that farms spent 6.8 cents of the money they earned to purchase products from the other industry groups. (After all, even farmers may eat at McDonald’s.) Since Warren used the phrasing about how much of the agriculture dollars “went into a farmer’s pocket,” the lower number of 7.8 cents may be more appropriate than 15 cents. (Even this figure, however, does not account for 1.4 cents that must go to hire labor, so the amount going into “the farmer’s pocket” is even lower.)

Does the United States have a high rate of people in prison?		
Year after year, the United States beats out much larger countries – India, China – and more totalitarian ones –Russia and the Philippines – for the distinction of having the highest incarceration rate in the world.

According to a 2018 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), nearly 2.2 million adults were held in America’s prisons and jails at the end of 2016. That means for every 100,000 people residing in the United States, approximately 655 of them were behind bars.		

Why does the United States have more people in prison?		
- Most inmates are held in state prisons and local jails – not federal prisons.

-In many cities and states, money often decides who stays in jail and who gets out.

- Once you’re in the criminal justice system, it’s often difficult to get out.		

Is the presence of telephone justice in Russia problematic?		
In the Russian Federation, judges remain prone to undue influence. A 2010 ICJ mission learned that the phenomenon of “telephone justice” remained widespread: reportedly, judges are often – as a matter of routine – directly instructed by the court president how to resolve a specific case. The ICJ’s interlocutors also stressed the fact that as judges are aware of the expectations of a particular outcome in a case over which they preside regardless of the evidence, there is often no need to give direct instructions. Furthermore when such expectations are not met, a judicial decision may be overturned or not implemented and the judge may face discipline as a result of having issued an “erroneous” decision. Two types of cases, in which “telephone justice” is particularly prevalent, were singled out: criminal cases for conduct considered to be terrorism-related and cases related to the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression or peaceful assembly.[15]

A fake survey claiming that the Bharatiya Janata Party would win 135 seats in the forthcoming Karnataka elections has been doing the rounds on WhatsApp—with a BBC link provided for legitimacy. The link, of course, merely leads to BBC’s India home page. This is the latest in a long string of fake news that has plagued the build-up to the elections.

Electoral dirty tricks and propaganda have always been a part of politics. Stalin infamously urged writers to become “engineers of human souls"". What is new is the ease and scale with which technology can compromise our political process. The role social media, with its dopamine highs, played in Brexit and the 2016 US presidential election are the standout examples, but it goes beyond that. The US military has been experimenting with “computational propaganda"" in Cuba and the Middle East. The Russians are developing software for information warfare. Then there are drug cartels in Mexico suppressing Twitter debates. Regimes are busy building digital dictatorships—from China’s Citizen Score initiative to Singapore’s “data controlled society"".

This is the evolution of espionage 2.0 with the entire electoral process at risk. Election machinery could be attacked. Data could be stolen, information leaked and systems brought to a standstill. There could be hacks into databases, and cyber attacks on election war rooms and critical Election Commission (EC) infrastructure. This is not fearmongering.

the wearing of a veil or hat for women seems to have been a fairly consistent practice in the Church in the West until fairly recently. Practices in the Eastern and Orthodox Churches have varied. Protestant denominations also show a wide diversity in this matter. The 1917 Code of Canon Law in  the Catholic Church mandated that women wear a veil or head covering. Prior to 1917 there was no universal Law but it was customary in most places for women to wear some sort of head covering. The 1983 Code of Canon Law made no mention of this requirement and by the 1980s most women, at least here in America, had ceased to wear veils or hats anyway. Currently there is no binding rule and the custom in most places is no head covering at all.

Scripture – In Biblical Times women generally wore veils in any public setting and this would include the Synagogue. The clearest New Testament reference to women veiling or covering their head is from St. Paul:		

Does the Headcovering Customs of the Ancient  Catholic Church includes wearing burkas ?		
I offer this survey of ancient headcovering practices in the hope that it will clear away some common misconceptions, and bring into sharper focus the customs which many biblical expositors have held to be so important for an understanding of the Apostle Paul's instruction to the Corinthians regarding headcoverings. Too often I find that the statements made by biblical expositors on this subject are inaccurate and simplistic. The more research I have done on the subject, the more I have come to see how problematic is the widely-accepted interpretation of 1 Corinthians 11:2-16 which asserts that Paul is merely urging the saints in Corinth to conform to local and secular customs. In my opinion this idea raises more problems than it solves.

I conclude that Paul's explanations pertain to an established Christian custom, which may or may not have corresponded to any Jewish, Greek, or Roman custom of the time. Most ""cultural background"" treatments of this subject have failed to recognize the importance of the fact that in the first century the Church was itself a sub-culture, having its own traditions and customs.

This survey was prepared as a supporting document for my exegetical commentary on 1 Corinthians 11:2-16, to which I refer the reader for more specific comments on Paul's explanation of the early Christian custom.n ancient times men did not wear trousers, and women did not wear skirts. There were no shirts or blouses such as we wear today, either. Both sexes usually wore flowing garments comparable to the modern woman's dress. (1) In the Greek language the basic article of clothing was called the chiton (χιτών), and in the Latin language it was called the tunica.

2486,MMR Vaccine does not causes autism in Children.,"Is there any data showing that vaccines can increase the risk of autism?		
The claim began with a 1998 study published in the Lancet, a British medical journal. The article has since been retracted. The study was led by gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield, MD. It claimed that, in an examination of 12 children, evidence of the measles virus had been found in the digestive systems of kids who had shown symptoms of autism after an MMR vaccination.		

What does recent research show?		
A massive 10-year study of more than 600,000 children has again confirmed that vaccines do not cause autism.

Why do memes sometimes get shared as if it were verified news?		
Computer and Information Scientists at Indiana University Bloomington think their model has the answers. Dr. Filippo Menczer, Dr.Xiaoyan Qiu and others at Indiana University Bloomington believe their research demonstrates that these questions can be answered by just three factors: “the enormous amount of information out there; the limited amount of time and attention people can devote to scrolling through their news feeds and choosing what to share; and the structure of the underlying social networks.”

Dr.Menczer talks about if people are being manipulated or tricked:“You could assume that people do know the difference, and still the fake stuff would go viral, simply because of information overload.” The researchers also explain that if the simulation of the networks is assumed to be random- meaning the connections equally distributed throughout the network no memes get shared millions of times. However real-world social networks (like Twitter) have some users who have hundreds of thousands of connections (followers)  and these users tend to tip the scale in favor of certain memes causing them to become viral.

Congress established the diversity visa program through the Immigration Act of 1990 in an effort to promote immigration from countries underrepresented in the United States. The number of diversity visas is limited by law to 55,000 per fiscal year, but the annual cap has been reduced to 50,000 since fiscal year 2000. While Congress called this cap a “temporary reduction,” it does not have an expiration date. As of 2017, the U.S. government states that this reduction will remain in effect as long as needed, including for 2019.

The diversity visa program makes up to 50,000 visas available each year to natives of eligible countries. The program is well known as the ""diversity lottery,"" since potential visa recipients are randomly selected from the pool of qualified entries. Yet, being randomly selected—or ""winning"" the lottery—does not guarantee admission to the United States but rather provides the individual an opportunity to apply for the Diversity Visa. The odds of being selected for this opportunity are very small, with an average of 13.3 million people submitting applications each year.		

Who is eligible for the diversity visa program?		
Only nationals of low-admission countries—defined as any country with fewer than 50,000 natives admitted to the United States in the previous five years—are eligible to enter the diversity lottery. Natives of countries that traditionally send large numbers of immigrants to the United States, such as Mexico, India, and China, are generally not eligible.

Eligible countries are grouped into six geographic regions: Europe; Africa; Asia; Oceania; North America (excluding Mexico); and South America, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) calculates each region’s annual diversity visa allotment using a specific formula and recent immigration statistics. The allocation formula, which is recalculated every year, gives fewer visas to “high-admission” regions, or any region that accounted for more than a sixth of all immigrant admissions to the United States in the previous five years.   Additionally, no more than 7 percent of the year's available visas may go to natives of any one country.

To be eligible for a diversity visa, applicants must be admissible to the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and have either a high-school education (or its equivalent) or at least two years of recent qualifying work experience. The applicant or the applicant’s spouse must be a native of one of the countries that qualify for the diversity visa program.

The diversity visa program only accepts applications submitted electronically within a short timeframe designated each year. Eligible applicants are limited to one entry per registration period and will be disqualified for submitting multiple entries.		

What security precautions have been put in place for the Diversity Visa Program?		
Diversity lottery ""winners"" have a short period of time to file the necessary paperwork and undergo extensive screening before a visa will be issued, including multiple identity confirmations using biometrics, criminal and security background checks, cross-checks with various watch-lists, and in-person interviews. These requirements and security procedures also apply for any family members (spouses and minor children) whom the lottery winner petitions to bring to the United States as derivatives.

An individual may be issued a visa and admitted into the United States only after passing all electronic and in-person screenings. If visa processing for a lottery winner or an eligible family member is not completed before the end of the fiscal year, the U.S. government will deny the application, and the person loses the opportunity to immigrate to the United States through that year's diversity visa program. While the individual may be eligible to enter the diversity lottery in future years, the chances of again being randomly selected to apply for the visa are slim.

2507,Medicare for All would result in massive tax increases like never before as well as the loss of private coverage for over 180 million Americans.,"What is Medicare for All?		
Sanders’ idea of Medicare for All would be a single, national health insurance program that would cover everyone who lives in the United States. In the bill he introduced in 2017, it would pay for every medically necessary service, from routine doctor visits to surgery to mental health to prescription drugs. Dental and vision care are part of the package, too. The details on long-term care might vary between the Senate and House versions, but broadly speaking, nursing home and related care grow under both proposals.

The government would set payment rates for services, drugs and medical equipment. Each year, the secretary of Health and Human Services would determine a national budget for all covered services and spending would be limited by that cap. For individuals, there would be no costs — no deductibles, no copays or coinsurance. The two exceptions would be for some prescription drugs — though that would be limited to $200 a year — and possibly for long-term care.

It would replace all other insurance, with limited exceptions, such as cosmetic surgery. Employer-provided insurance, Medicaid and ultimately Medicare would all disappear.		

Will taxes rise to pay for Medicare for All?		
To that, he would raise taxes on income over $250,000, reaching a 52 percent marginal rate on income over $10 million. He suggested a wealth tax on the top 0.1 percent of households.		

Will Medicare take private coverage away from over 180 million Americans?		
it would mean that the roughly 180 million Americans who have private insurance would see their plans canceled.		

Is Medicare for All preferable to the current system of private insurance?		
Medicare for All is much more generous than the current Medicare program. Right now, the Medicare program is for Americans 65 and over; they receive care, but they’re also responsible for part of the costs. Unlike traditional Medicare, Sanders’ Medicare for All would cover medical bills completely, with no burden on the patient. There would be no Medigap insurance or Medicare Advantage.

The leaders of major veterans groups looked around uncomfortably. What Trump called “choice” these veterans groups called “privatization,” and they’d been warning for years that it would cost taxpayers more money and deliver worse care for veterans. The veterans groups had endorsed the bill, but Trump’s description of it was not what they thought they were there to support.		

What are the issues surrounding Donald Trump's Veteran Choice Program signed in 2018?		
The cost of expanding private care is hard to predict, but VA officials have told Congress and veterans groups that it will range from $13.9 billion to $32.1 billion over five years.

Since the administration opposes lifting overall government spending, Democrats say the increased cost of private care will come at the expense of the VA’s own health system. Some lawmakers said the administration’s plan defies the purpose of the law they passed.

What is classified as bankruptcy in the US?		
• Chapter 7 - This is the basic theory of bankruptcy under which a debtor gathers their assets, liquidates them, pays as many bills as possible, and then the unpaid bills go unpaid. ""In this case, the debtor is hoping to hold onto a few dollars so that (he) can keep on going with (his) own life and re-establish some economic foundation for (himself),"" Saxowsky says.

Individual debtors discharge as much debt as possible, but keep as much exempt property as possible for a ""fresh start."" A corporation has no exemptions.

• Chapter 11 - The debtor wants to reorganize and hold onto their business. This is typically used for corporations and individuals whose debt limits are too high to qualify for Chapter 13, a class for wage-earners, Minch says. There are no debt limits in Chapter 11.

Saxowsky says the debtor may have to repay debts over a longer period of time than in the original loan agreement. Debtors continue to run the business as a debtor-in-possession, unless the court finds that assets are improperly managed or that the debtor in possession is violating court orders. Then a trustee is appointed.

• Chapter 12 - This is a special chapter created by Congress in 1985, during the last farm credit crisis. It is especially for smaller ""family farms"" and ""family fisherman"" to avoid liquidation and foreclosure. It was created as a temporary measure and made permanent in 2005.

Roger Minch, a Fargo lawyer who works in business law, says a Chapter 12 is the way to go for farmers in need of debt reorganization, but it's only possible if the farm is within limits.

2550,Formaldehyde is in vaccines and causes cancer in humans among other issues and is banned from vaccines in most European countries,"Is formaldehyde in vaccines?		
Yes, It is used in the production of some vaccines to inactivate toxins from bacteria and viruses (for example, poliovirus, Hepatitis B antigen, and diphtheria and tetanus toxins). It is possible that tiny traces may remain in the 6-in-1 vaccine (Infanrix Hexa), Hepatitis B vaccine (HBVaxPro), one of the Pre-school Booster vaccines (Repevax), and the Teenage Booster vaccine (Revaxis). However, formaldehyde breaks down quickly in water (and most of the vaccine is water).		

How much formaldehyde is in the vaccines?		
The human body produces and uses formaldehyde as part of the process of metabolism. The amount of natural formaldehyde in a 2-month-old infant’s blood (around 1.1 milligrams in total) is ten times greater than the amount found in any vaccine (less than 0.1 milligrams). A pear contains around 50 times more formaldehyde than is found in any vaccine.		

Is formaldehyde banned for use in Europe?		
No: The EU is taking further steps to protect workers from exposure to carcinogens. The Council today adopted its position (general approach) on a proposal which will update the existing rules on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens or mutagens at work (Directive 2004/37/EC). The aim of the proposal, which was presented by the Commission in April this year, is to reduce the exposure levels for 5 carcinogenic chemical agents - cadmium, beryllium, arsenic acid, formaldehyde and 4,4'-Methylene-bis(2-chloroaniline)(MOCA).

Estimates show that this proposal, when adopted, would in the longer term improve working conditions for over 1 000 000 workers in the EU and should prevent more than 22 000 cases of work-related ill-health. It is a very good example of how the EU is taking concrete steps to protect its citizens.

Is there a link between thiomersal (also known as thimerosal) in vaccines and developing autism?		
Valid scientific studies have shown there is no link between thimerosal and autism. In fact, autism rates have actually increased since thimerosal was removed from childhood vaccines. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Medical Association (AMA), the CDC, and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) agree that science does not support a link between thimerosal in vaccines and autism.		

Does the mercury-based chemical thiomersal (also known as thimerosal) in vaccines cause side effects?

Income (farm-operator households receive income from farm and off-farm sources):		

What are off farm resources?		
Off-farm sources—including wage income, nonfarm business earnings, dividends, and transfers—are the main contributor to income for most farm operator households in the United States, including the majority of residential and intermediate farm households (see glossary for definitions). These households, which derive less than half their income from farming, are not as affected by changes in farming costs and returns as are large commercial farms, but may be more susceptible to changes in the broader economy.		

Are farmers seeing a decline in their income and declaring bankruptcy in record numbers?		
Many farm households primarily rely on off-farm income: median off-farm income in 2021 is estimated at $82,809, an increase of 22 percent from $67,873 in 2020, and to continue increasing by 6.3 percent to $88,034 in 2022. The increase in 2021 was mainly due to higher earned income—income from wages, salary, and nonfarm businesses—which rose 54 percent from $32,428 in 2020 to $50,000 in 2021.

Congress established the diversity visa program through the Immigration Act of 1990 in an effort to promote immigration from countries underrepresented in the United States. The number of diversity visas is limited by law to 55,000 per fiscal year, but the annual cap has been reduced to 50,000 since fiscal year 2000. While Congress called this cap a “temporary reduction,” it does not have an expiration date. As of 2017, the U.S. government states that this reduction will remain in effect as long as needed, including for 2019.		

Do countries send immigrants to the US lottery.		
No, Potential visa recipients are randomly selected from the pool of qualified entries, administered by the United States, not foreign governments. Yet, being randomly selected—or ""winning"" the lottery—does not guarantee admission to the United States but rather provides the individual an opportunity to apply for the Diversity Visa. The odds of being selected for this opportunity are very small, with an average of 13.3 million people submitting applications each year.

President Barack Obama’s administration racked up nearly as much debt in eight years than in the entire 232-year history of the country before he took office. He entered with $10.6 trillion in total debt and left with the country owing $19.9 trillion. That’s an average tab of $1.16 trillion a year.		

How much debt the US government added under President Obama ?		
Based on quarterly data released by the US Treasury, the debt at the end of 2008 — just before Obama took office — stood at roughly $10,699,805,000,000. As of the third quarter of 2016, the most recent data available, the debt as Obama is set to leave office stood at $19,573,445,000,000.

Based on the website USdebtclock.com, which extrapolates the US national debt in real time based on committed government spending, the debt will be roughly $19.97 trillion when President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Friday.

Thus, the national debt under Obama will have grown by about $9 trillion, or an increase of 86%.

Some of this debt is attributable to bills passed by Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, since the federal government's fiscal year budget operate differently from the calendar year.

Trump is issuing the declaration under the National Emergencies Act of 1976, which lets presidents issue an emergency declaration but under certain constraints — namely, Trump can only use specific powers Congress has already codified by law, and he has to say which powers he’s using. The act doesn’t define what counts as an emergency… there’s enough ambiguity in the law to let Trump declare an emergency. But the maneuver may not stand up to legal scrutiny once challenged in court. He is effectively trying to circumvent Congress — which is supposed to have the “power of the purse” and has decided against funding his border wall.

What lawsuits could emerge in the border states as a result of the emergency order to secure funding for the border wall?		
Long before Trump’s emergency declaration, one likely source of resistance has been clear: people who own land along the US-Mexico border where Trump wants the wall to be built.
The federal government can legally invoke “eminent domain,” a power to take private land or property and convert it into public use enshrined within the US Constitution, but if Trump tries to do so for the border wall, he could very well face a fight.

In March 2010, Mr. Saipov flew into Kennedy International Airport in New York City, his first time in the United States, and made his way to the home of a friend of his father’s in the northeast outskirts of Cincinnati.		

Did Saipov bring his family to the USA?		
No, Although his grandfather sometimes visited from Uzbekistan, his parents never did, Mr. Muminov said.

Neither U.S. citizens nor lawful permanent residents can directly petition for an aunt, uncle, cousin, niece, nephew, in-law relative or grandparent to come to the United States.

U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents (green card holders) can bring certain family members to the United States to live here permanently.

The most commonly abused drugs are:
Marijuana
Cocaine
Opiates e.g. Heroin
Methamphetamine		

Of all the big drugs seized by US officials in 2018, what percentage were seized at US ports of entry (as opposed to being seized between ports of entry along the border)?		
According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection statistics, 90 percent of heroin seized along the border, 88 percent of cocaine, and 84 percent of the methamphetamine in the 2018 fiscal year was caught trying to be smuggled in at legal crossing points.
The exception is marijuana, only 39 percent of which was seized at ports of entry, according to the CBP.		

If US government data shows the majority of the drugs seized along the border were seized at the ports of entry, does this conclusively prove that most drugs in the US come through legal ports of entry?		
No, According to the Congressional Research Service: “data on seizures are available, but these reflect an unknown portion of total drugs traversing U.S. borders.""		

Is there any prove that the drugs were moved through the USA border		
The data also show that fentanyl, another opioid, was seized at ports of entry at a higher rate than at points between ports of entry. CBP recently intercepted a record amount of fentanyl worth $4.6 million at the Port of Nogales.

What has Beto O’Rourke said about veterans?		
I will strengthen services for those who have put their lives on the line for this country.

My top priority while serving in Congress was delivering for Texas veterans. Serving on both the Veterans Affairs and Armed Services committees in the U.S. House of Representatives, I worked with Republicans and Democrats alike to lift up the heroes who have put their lives on the line for our country.
My VA health care reform plan added two new VA clinics in my hometown of El Paso, nearly doubled the number of mental health providers at the local VA, and ultimately brought wait times down from an average of 71 days to an average of 5 days.

In addition, I authored and passed legislation that expanded access to VA mental health care to veterans with other-than-honorable discharges, granted every separating service member access to a mental health screening, improved and customized transition assistance for service members leaving the military—and more.

Texas can and must do more to serve our veterans. As governor, I will prioritize efforts to end veteran homelessness in Texas by the end of my first year in office, cut property taxes for disabled and low-income veterans, dramatically expand the state’s veterans health care case management system, strengthen services for veterans suffering from toxic exposure, expand access to medical marijuana and other alternatives to harmful opioids, and strengthen access to the education and employment benefits that our veterans have earned.

And even when it comes down to something like air travel, which the FAQ’s say they want to eliminate within the next ten years, that means the government is going to be telling people where they can fly to and where they can’t.		

What is listed in the Green New Deal FAQ's about air travel.		
To totally overhaul transportation by massively expanding electric vehicle  manufacturing, build charging stations everywhere, build out highspeed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary, create affordable public transit available to all, with goal to replace every combustion-engine vehicle - as listed under 'National mobilization our economy through 14 infrastructure and industrial projects.' - Every project strives to remove greenhouse gas emissions and pollution from every sector of our economy, as part of the 'Resolution Summary'		

How does Liz Cheney suggest that air travel will be eliminated?		
Liz Cheney stated, ""I would just say that it’s going to be crucially important for us to recognize and understand when we outlaw plane travel, we outlaw gasoline, we outlaw cars, I think actually probably the entire US military because of the Green New Deal that we are able to explain to our constituents and to people all across this country what that really means. And even when it comes down to something like air travel, which the FAQ’s say they want to eliminate within the next ten years.""		

Does the FAQ documentation propose a plan to eliminate or outlaw air travel in the next 10 years?		
No, The FAQ's state, ""We are calling for a full transition off fossil fuels and zero greenhouse gases. Anyone who has read the resolution sees that we spell this out through a plan that calls for eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from every sector of the economy.
Simply banning fossil fuels immediately won’t build the new economy to replace it – this is the plan to build that new economy and spells out how to do it technically. We do this through a huge mobilization to create the renewable energy economy as fast as possible. We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years.""		

How does the FAQ documentation explain net-zero versus zero emissions?		
We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero.

Blood type diets may yield weight loss and other positive results because they’re highly restrictive. They also eliminate foods which are known to adversely affect health.

However, there’s no scientific evidence linking a person’s blood type to their need to avoid, or eat, specific foods.		

Can fatigue be fought  It with the blood type diet ?

“That is very false information,” he said. “Forget about it, there’s nothing like that.”		

Does having a diet based on your blood type fights fatigue ?		
No answer could be found.		

What are the dietary suggestions for fighting fatigue ?		
Have a good look at your diet – it’s very important if you want more energy in your daily life. Suggestions include:

    Drink plenty of water – sometimes you feel tired simply because you’re mildly dehydrated. A glass of water will help do the trick, especially after exercise.
    Be careful with caffeine – anyone feeling tired should cut out caffeine. The best way to do this is to gradually stop having all caffeine drinks (that includes coffee, tea and cola drinks) over a three-week period. Try to stay off caffeine completely for a month to see if you feel less tired without it.
    Eat breakfast – food boosts your metabolism and gives the body energy to burn. The brain relies on glucose for fuel, so choose carbohydrate-rich breakfast foods such as cereals or wholegrain bread.
    Don’t skip meals – going without food for too long allows blood sugar levels to dip. Try to eat regularly to maintain your energy levels throughout the day.
    Eat a healthy diet – increase the amount of fruit, vegetables, wholegrain foods, low fat dairy products and lean meats in your diet. Reduce the amount of high fat, high sugar and high salt foods.
    Don’t overeat – large meals can drain your energy. Instead of eating three big meals per day, try eating six mini-meals to spread your kilojoule intake more evenly. This will result in more constant blood sugar and insulin levels. You’ll also find it easier to lose excess body fat if you eat this way.
    Eat iron rich foods – women, in particular, are prone to iron-deficiency (anaemia), which can lead to feeling fatigued. Make sure your diet includes iron-rich foods such as lean red meat.

The Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) project is one of Kenya's Vision 2030 flagship projects that will play an important role in improving the transport system as well as strengthening cooperation among East Africa Community (EAC) Member states and promote economic development of the region.

The old meter gauge line, initially called the Uganda Railway, was built between 1896 and 1901, a time when the land had yet to acquire the name Kenya. For British colonists, it was a vast yet insignificant land that stood between them and the rich resources in Uganda. To open up Uganda, to tighten control over the ""British East Africa"" and to end the then notorious slave trade, the British government decided to lay a rail line to link the port of Mombasa and Uganda.

Second, not all crude oil is the same. It ranges from light to heavy, high to low sulfur and sour to sweet. The bulk of the oil currently produced in the United States is light oil. And not all refineries are the same. Many Gulf Coast and Midwest refineries were designed to process heavy oil from Canada, Venezuela and Mexico.

On regular drinking
New weekly guideline [this applies for people who drink regularly or frequently i.e. most
weeks].
The Chief Medical Officers’ guideline for both men and women is that:
• You are safest not to drink regularly more than 14 units per week, to keep health
risks from drinking alcohol to a low level.
• If you do drink as much as 14 units per week, it is best to spread this evenly over
3 days or more. If you have one or two heavy drinking sessions, you increase
your risks of death from long term illnesses and from accidents and injuries.
• The risk of developing a range of illnesses (including, for example, cancers of
the mouth, throat and breast) increases with any amount you drink on a regular
basis.
• If you wish to cut down the amount you’re drinking, a good way to help achieve
this is to have several drink-free days each week.

What is the recommended drinking  levels for people in the UK ?		
The UK Chief Medical Officers considered and accepted the advice of the expert group
and agreed on 3 main recommendations:
• A weekly guideline on regular drinking;
• Advice on single episodes of drinking; and
• A guideline on pregnancy and drinking.
On regular drinking
New weekly guideline [this applies for people who drink regularly or frequently i.e. most
weeks].
The Chief Medical Officers’ guideline for both men and women is that:
• You are safest not to drink regularly more than 14 units per week, to keep health
risks from drinking alcohol to a low level.
• If you do drink as much as 14 units per week, it is best to spread this evenly over
3 days or more. If you have one or two heavy drinking sessions, you increase
your risks of death from long term illnesses and from accidents and injuries.
• The risk of developing a range of illnesses (including, for example, cancers of
the mouth, throat and breast) increases with any amount you drink on a regular
basis.
• If you wish to cut down the amount you’re drinking, a good way to help achieve
this is to have several drink-free days each week.		

What percent of adults aged 16+ drank more than 14 units per week?		
21% (Very close to the 1 in 5 as per claim)

Is the Kenya Ports Authority looking to hire 140 people, aged 18–35, who have graduated from a well-recognized university between 2012 and 2018?		
No, The attention of the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) Management has been drawn to the actions of some fraudsters who are inviting unsuspecting job seekers for employment at the Authority. The deceitful advert targeting the youth has been circulated via social media and other online platforms.

We wish to clarify that KPA has a clear recruitment policy which includes publishing of vacancies in the mainstream newspapers and on the KPA website www.kpa.co.ke. Thereafter, formal communication on interviews for shortlisted applicants is undertaken. It should also be noted that the Authority has official domain email addresses which are on our website and not the gmail address indicated in the fake advert. Further, it should be noted that all recruitment activities in KPA are devoid of any payments.

Members of the public are therefore advised to ignore the messages circulating on social media and other online platforms purporting that KPA has advertised 140 vacancies targeting diploma and degree holders. This is a hoax. We therefore advise members of the public to beware of such conmen/fraudsters and to imme- diately report any such incidents to the Authority or the nearest Police Station.
KPA is committed to best practice and the principles of transparency and equal employment opportunities to all, when such opportunities arise, as enunciated in the Constitution of Kenya.

Earlier in January, the German Association of Journalists (DJV) urged the state media regulatory authorities not to grant a broadcasting license to the channel Russia Today for its website RT Deutsch.

“Russia Today is not an information medium for us, but a propaganda instrument of the Kremlin, which tries to make politics with disinformation,"" said DJV Federal Chairman Frank Überall. He added that, RT ""has repeatedly invented stories in the past."" There should not be a broadcasting license for a propaganda station.""		

Was this a campaign against Russian Media?		
No, Following Zakharova’s press conference on January 31, DJV issued a statement saying that there was no campaign against Russian foreign media in Germany, there is only “unanimous criticism toward the methods of their work.”

The editor-in-chief of T-online.de Florian Harms, and Christian Mihr, the Managing Director of the German office of “Reporters without Borders,” an International NGO based in Paris, joined in denying the Russian allegations.

The German government also rejected Russian MFA’s accusations that German press, in cooperation with the government, are waging a campaign against Russian media. Government spokesperson Steffen Seibert said, “Those who spread such unfounded claims have little to no idea of Germany and little idea of freedom of the press. I explicitly reject such allegations.”		

Why are German media critic of Russia?		
RT and Sputnik face mistrust not only in Germany, but throughout most of Europe, including Britain and France. The French government has opened an investigation into possible Russian interference during the Yellow Vest protests last year, when social-media accounts linked to Moscow spread false news published by Russia Today and Sputnik.

An earlier fact check established that Moscow used the two outlets to undermine Emmanuel Macron’s presidential election campaign in 2017.

Macron has stated openly in the presence of Russian President Vladimir Putin that “Russia Today and Sputnik were agents of influence and propaganda that spread falsehoods about me and my campaign.”

And in December 2018, UK’s media regulator Ofcom, which has launched numerous probes of RT activities, found that the Russian channel has failed to comply with Britain’s broadcasting rules, which could result in fines and ultimately revocation of its broadcast license.

Is the Church of Satan involved in satanism?		
Why do Satanists worship The Devil?

We don’t. Satanists are atheists. We see the universe as being indifferent to us, and so all morals and values are subjective human constructions.

Our position is to be self-centered, with ourselves being the most important person (the “God”) of our subjective universe, so we are sometimes said to worship ourselves. Our current High Priest Gilmore calls this the step moving from being an atheist to being an “I-Theist.”

Satan to us is a symbol of pride, liberty and individualism, and it serves as an external metaphorical projection of our highest personal potential. We do not believe in Satan as a being or person.

What does toothpaste do to acne		
Toothpaste irritates the skin, so some may believe that it dries out pimples, but what it really does is irritate and cause redness and peeling		

Can toothpaste be used to treat pimples?		
An internet search turns up many quick-fixes for pimples. Here’s Dr. Khetarpal’s take on some of the most common ones.

Toothpaste. Many toothpastes contain ingredients like alcohol or baking soda that may help dry out a pimple. But, toothpaste also contains other ingredients that aren’t intended to be put directly on your face. She cautions that using toothpaste to treat a pimple could possibly irritate your skin.		

What are the cons of using toothpaste on acne spots?		
Skin irritation

Applying the paste on acne is one of the most tried and tested home remedies. The ingredient triclosan kills the bacteria causing acne on the skin. This ingredient immediately acts on the pimple and gives you fast results and sounds very promising. But, this hack also comes with a lot of skin irritation. The paste is made for teeth, which means the concentration is higher and harsher, hence the itching and the burning sensation is caused.

Dryness

When it comes to those big hideous pimples, toothpaste can immediately decrease the size. You may banish the pimple size, but this will also make your skin extremely dry. If you have acne-prone skin, then you can even witness more zits with the skin irritation and dryness.

Scars

At worst situations, applying the paste on acne can also lead to scars. For those angry red zits, toothpaste will cause a lot of burning sensation, which will eventually dry out the pimple. But with such harsh reaction, sometimes you can also be left with an ugly acne scar.		

What are the cons of using toothpaste on acne spots?		
According to Dr Sharkar, ""Although toothpaste will dry out your pimple, it may also leave you with dry, irritated, flaky, and peeling red skin."" It's important to know that most generic toothpastes contain ingredients such as baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, alcohol, menthol, and calcium carbonate, which will irritate your skin and might even burn it, depending on how long you leave the toothpaste on. Besides, as she rightly pointed out to me, many people are already seeking out more natural or gentle alternatives to commercial toothpaste, and ""if it's not good enough for brushing our teeth, why would it be good enough for treating our spots?""		

Does toothpaste help reduce acne?		
The reason why toothpaste is said to help reduce acne is an ingredient called triclosan, which is antibacterial and assists in killing the acne causing bacteria. However, triclosan is a controversial ingredient which has been liked to hormone disruption, so many companies are ditching the component altogether. So, if the toothpaste does not contain triclosan, you might not get any acne healing results.

According to ACOG, tubal sterilization may be recommended as a safe and effective method for women who desire permanent contraception. Women should be counseled that tubal ligation is not intended to be reversible; therefore, those who do not want permanent contraception should be counseled to consider other methods of contraception.

To reduce future regret, the patient and her partner, when appropriate, should be counseled.

2809,Shops buy apples that are coated with wax.,"Do apples naturally have a coat of wax?		
Yes, Pick an apple off a tree, buff it a little and it will shine! That’s because the fruit is coated with a layer of natural wax that protects it from drying out and helps to prevent fungi from getting a foothold.		

What is an apple's natural wax made of?		
The wax is a mixture of up to fifty different compounds, most of which fall into the chemical category known as esters. There are also alcohols like heptacosanol and malol as well as hydrocarbons such as triacontane, C30H62. This compound can also be isolated from petroleum and is sometimes applied to fruit to supplement its natural wax. In that case chemophobes kick and scream about a petroleum derivative being applied to their fruit but there is no difference between triacontane produced by an apple isolated from petroleum.		

Do shop bought apples still have their natural wax?		
No, After apples are picked they are washed before they appear in the supermarket to remove dirt and chemical residues. This process also removes the wax. Since the waxy layer prevents moisture in the apple from escaping, its loss shortens the storage time for the fruit.		

Do apple producers spray them with wax?		
Yes, Producers therefore spray the fruit with a thin layer of wax to prevent such moisture loss as well as to make the apple look more appealing. The applied layer is very thin, only about 3 mg of wax coat an apple.

2812,Sen. Ted Cruz's 2018 campaign tried to trick elderly Texans with suspicious mailers,"Was there anything controversial about any campaign letters sent out by Senator Ted Cruz in 2018?		
Ted Cruz’s Senate re-election campaign has been sending voters in Texas a fund-raising letter in an envelope labeled “summons enclosed,” drawing criticism from some who called it misleading and raising questions about whether such a practice was legal.

Confusion arises not just from the letter itself but from the envelope it arrives in.

The fund-raising appeal comes in an envelope with the words “SUMMONS ENCLOSED — OPEN IMMEDIATELY” written across it in large capital letters. In the upper left-hand corner are three lines of text: “Official Travis County Summons, Voter Enrollment Campaign Division, Ted Cruz for Senate 2018.”		

Were the 2018 campaign letters sent out by Ted Cruz in envelopes labelled “summons enclosed”, directly targeting elderly Texans?		
No, However the concern that elderly voters could be tricked was raised when a photo of one of the letters was posted to Twitter on Sunday by Sean Owen, a data scientist who said it arrived at his home in Austin, Tex., and was addressed to his grandmother, who lived there until she died in April.

“My grandmother was facing cognitive decline at the end of her life and I think if she’d read this she might have been deceived by it,” he said in a phone interview. “It feels shady.”		

Were the 2018 campaign letters sent out by Ted Cruz in envelopes labelled “summons enclosed”, illegal?		
No, The practice is legal according to Myles Martin, a spokesman for the Federal Election Commission, who said the salient question was whether a mailing contains a disclaimer saying that it came from a political campaign. And this one did.

Aside from that, he said in an email, “the F.E.C.’s regulations don’t speak to how candidates may choose to word particular solicitations to potential contributors.”

The letter inside the envelope is more clearly part of a fund-raising effort. The Cruz campaign logo appears at the top of the letter and recipients are given the option to donate a preselected amount of money or to write in their own denominations.

The letter echoes its envelope, though, in its use of language — like “campaign summons” and “conservative affirmation” — that sounds more legal than colloquial.		

Did the 2018 campaign letters sent out by Ted Cruz in envelopes labelled “summons enclosed” raise any ethical concerns?		
Yes, The San-Antonio Express News wrote an editorial headlined: Cruz should rethink his ""summons"" mailer.
The editorial said:
“.. the problem is the Cruz campaign has made the envelope look much like a legal summons, which can be pretty serious. A summons occurs when a person is sued or ordered to appear in court. Most people are probably not thrilled about getting such a summons.

A reader brought this mailer to our attention because she viewed it as misleading and intimidating. 

… we think the Cruz campaign could do without the legal summons language on the envelope. It’s just too official looking…. It’s understandable he would want to summon conservative support. But certainly his campaign can do that without making it look like a legal threat, right?”

2813,Consuming a wax-coated apple can kill you.,"What is the wax covering apples?		
It’s not artificial, but a natural wax that we call “Abura-agari” in Japanese.		

Why are apples covered in wax?		
Fruits like plums, apples, pears etc. have natural wax covering for the retainment of moisture and firmness, and slow down of the natural degradation.

But it is not possible for the farmers and the storekeepers to keep the fruits fresh and juicy for several months at a stretch. Additional food grade wax is being used for increasing the fruit’s shelf-life.		

Is the wax on Apples toxic?		
No. It is not toxic. Apples grow with a natural wax. Pick an apple straight from the tree and it does not have that shiny supermarket lustre. However, rub a freshly picked apple with a cloth or on your thigh like a spin bowler and it will quickly shine up. Apples bound for the greengrocer and supermarket are generally washed, polished and coated in a food-grade glazing agent. Fifteen per cent of Australian apples are coated in carnauba wax made from the leaves of a tropical palm straight from the tree. Most of the other 85 per cent are coated in shellac which is made from the lac beetle. It is not made from the beetle itself but a secretion produced by the female lac beetle to protect her eggs. Another little thing vegans need to look out for. You'll find similar glazing agents on shiny confectionary. For people who are very sensitive to bitterness the wax can be perceived as a little bit bitter.		

Is the natural wax on apples safe for consumption?		
Since it is of natural origin, it is safe to eat the wax. The linoleic acid and the oleic acid are types of *unsaturated fatty acids and said to have a rich nutritional value.
(*Unsaturated fatty acid helps decrease bad cholesterol.)		

Is the artificial wax sometimes added onto apples toxic?		
The FDA has certified both the Shellac and Carnauba wax as risk-free for human consumption. Shellac, beewax, petroleum jelly and carnauba are edible waxes. Shellac is used for apple and other fruits coating to make them look shinier. D. Manoharlal (Shellac) Pvt. Ltd., the most prominent Shellac manufacturer of India, has opined that it can be used in coating medicines, confectioneries, food, hats, wood, and cosmetics safely as replacement of Candelilla and Carnauba Wax.

Human Rights Watch wrote in its World 2020 report: “Under the guise of fighting terrorism, Egyptian authorities showed utter disregard for the rule of law. Since April 2017, President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi has maintained a nation-wide state of emergency that gives security forces unchecked powers. Security forces used torture and enforced disappearances systematically against dissidents from all backgrounds. Egypt’s use of mass trials and the death penalty has mounted, including death sentences against children and death sentences issued in military trials.”		

What kinds of recorded atrocities have there been in Egypt under President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi?		
The police and National Security Agency routinely carry out systematic enforced disappearances and torture with impunity. Torture practices have also affected well-known activists such as Alaa Abdel Fattah and Israa Abdel Fattah. Authorities keep thousands of prisoners in abysmal conditions, where overcrowding and insufficient medical care have been systematic and may have contributed to the deteriorating health and deaths of scores of detainees.		

What kinds of recorded atrocities have there been in Egypt under President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi?		
Egyptian security forces, mainly the army, as well as ISIS-affiliated militants, committed serious and widespread abuses in North Sinai, some of which amount to war crimes, since the conflict escalated in late 2013. Human Rights Watch documented several indiscriminate and possibly unlawful air and ground attacks by security forces. Human Rights Watch also documented 50 cases of arbitrary arrests, of whom 39 were likely forcibly disappeared; at least 14 have been missing for three or four years. Both sides carried out extrajudicial killings. Since 2014, Human Rights Watch has documented 20 extrajudicial killings of residents by government forces.

The army has  arrested and forcibly disappeared children as young as 12. An army spokesman acknowledged some child detentions, justifying them as part of the army’s counterterrorism operations.

It should be noted that not all Leptospermum species produce active honey, and even within L. scoparium and L. polygalifolium honey MGO levels can range from ∼100 to >1200 ppm		

what conclusions have been found about Manuka honey?		
Great progress has been made recently in our understanding of therapeutic honey, yet its use in clinical medicine remains limited, even when conventional antibiotics are starting to fail. The complexity in honey, which is arguably its greatest strength in killing diverse pathogens and preventing resistance, complicates its study as many factors working together are likely to affect activity. We advocate further mechanistic studies using appropriately registered therapeutic manuka honey, in particular studies that use non-reductionist systems biology approaches, along with detailed chemical and microbiological analyses to elucidate how honey acts at the molecular, cellular and population level, how this can differ in different strains and species of microbial pathogens, and how the host cell responds		

It seems that Manuka honey is very effective on topical wounds, but is it good at killing bacteria internally?		
Manuka may inhibit the bacteria that cause a sore (“strep”) throat or gingivitis, but the main components responsible for the antimicrobial activity won’t survive the digestion process.

The researchers grew human glioblastoma (a type of brain tumour) cells in the laboratory. They then treated some of these cells with increasing concentrations of three compounds found in garlic. Other cells which were not treated with these compounds were used as controls. They then looked at whether the treated and control cells survived. They also looked at what changes were happening in the cells that might explain how and why they lived or died.

The researchers found that all three compounds caused more glioblastoma cells to die (by a method known as apoptosis) than was observed in the untreated control cells. The higher the concentration of the compound used, the more cells died.

The researchers then reported their results and went into in-depth analysis about the biochemical changes occurring in these cells.

The researchers concluded that garlic compounds cause human glioblastoma cells to die by apoptosis. They also drew conclusions about what biochemical changes might play a role in this cell death.		

What did the NHS Knowledge Service make of this study?		
This was a laboratory study, and no conclusions about the effects of garlic on human health can be drawn from it.

This study did not look at the effects of eating garlic in people who have glioblastoma; it also did not look at whether eating garlic prevents people developing cancer. In addition, this study did not look at the effects of these garlic compounds on healthy human cells; therefore it is possible that these compounds also kill healthy cells.

Based on this studies findings, we shouldn’t believe that eating garlic will prevent or cure cancer.

2885,A Biology Experiment By 9th Grade Students Reveals A Dark Truth About Wi-Fi & Gains The Attention Of Scientists,"What happened in the experiment?		
Some students in Denmark did a school experiment and found cress growing near wi-fi routers went brown.
Apparently the researchers (some 15-year-old schoolchildren, in a classroom experiment in Denmark), decided to run the experiment after noticing they had trouble concentrating the morning after sleeping close to their mobile phones.		

What did experts think of the experiment?		
The suggestion by scientists interviewed about the research is that routers give out heat, and this probably dried out the cress in the rooms with the routers in, so equivalent water was not enough for them.

There have been suggestions that the light from mobile phones or tablets just before bed can disrupt sleep patterns, although again there’s not really any strong evidence for this.		

Did a biology experiment by ninth grade students reveal a ""dark truth"" about the dangers of Wi-Fi?		
No, that is not clear: The study was conducted as a classroom experiment without the proper scientific controls of a professional lab experiment. The girls take 400 seeds and separated them out across 12 different trays. Six of the trays were placed in each of 2 rooms which were both kept at the same temperature.After 12 days,The cress seeds in the first room were growing well,the seeds that were placed next to the router showed no real growth at all. The scientist observed that The problem is that due to a difference in temperature of just a few degrees, it can already take a couple of days for the cress to grow to the same height.If there was indeed a difference in temperature due to the placement of the laptops, it would be likely that the WiFi group could have germinated and grown similar to the control group if it was allowed to grow on for a couple of days.Norwegian science journalist said We have published around 60 years of research in at least 1,300 peer-reviewed studies that are essentially unable to find any effect on EM radiation cells in the frequency range in question. Nothing. The World Health Organization (WHO) went through 25,000 articles on the topic published over the last 30 years without finding any evidence that such radiation can have a biological effect.

A PCN is a penalty for contravention of parking regulations. It can be paid, contested by appeal, or contested by defending a claim for payment under the small claims track of the county court.
You won’t get a criminal record or points on your licence.
Everything from how PCNs are served, through appeal or payment, to debt recovery is laid down in regulations. PCNs are used for some moving traffic offences too, particularly in London – bus lanes, no entry, restricted turn, yellow box junction.
You may get a PCN by post, by hand or applied to your car windscreen.
You’ve got 28 days to pay or challenge.
A PCN can be up to £70 outside London, and up to £130 in London.
The penalty is usually halved if paid within 14 days.
An unpaid PCN penalty is treated as a civil debt and you could be pursued through the county court system or even get a visit from the bailiff if the debt remains unpaid. Some local authorities don’t have civil parking enforcement powers and in these areas parking is enforced by the police or police-employed traffic wardens who will issue a Fixed Penalty Notice (FPN) enforced through the criminal justice system.		

Who issues Parking charge notices in the UK?		
A parking ticket for private land is called a Parking Charge Notice (PCN) – check your ticket for this wording.

You might get a parking ticket on private land from the owner or a company employed to manage the car park if you:

park without the owner’s permission, or
breach any parking conditions imposed by the owner. 
There may have been signs displaying the rules for using the car park. When you park on private land (like a private car park) you enter into a contract with the landowner. Any signs that clearly display rules for using the car park give you the terms of the contract. The car park owner can take steps to enforce any of these rules if broken.

Research (Doremalen et al 2020) published in the New England Journal of Medicine conducted by American scientists (preprint here) suggests that the new coronavirus (COVID-19) can live in the air for several hours and on some surfaces for as long as 2-3 days. They tested the virus by spraying into the air by a nebuliser mimicking the coughing action of an infected person. They found that it could be detected up to a minimum of 3 hours later in the air, up to 4 hours on copper surfaces, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to 2-3 days on plastic and stainless steel surfaces.

Individuals cannot become infected through ordinary day-to-day contact such as kissing, hugging, shaking hands, or sharing personal objects, food or water.		

At the time of the claim what was official advice on how coronavirus spread between humans?		
In March 2020 WHO explained the following.  According to current evidence, COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes. Droplet transmission occurs when a person is in in close contact (within 1 m) with someone who has respiratory symptoms (e.g., coughing or sneezing) and is therefore at risk of having his/her mucosae (mouth and nose) or conjunctiva (eyes) exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets.		

Does both HIV virus and the coronavirus spread the same way by direct contact and people should avoid touching the infected ?		
HIV and COVID spreads in different ways and not the same.
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) transmits mainly via respiratory droplets that people sneeze, cough, or exhale, in addition to touching contaminated surfaces or people and subsequently touch the face.

HIV does not spread by touching. It can spread by unprotected sex, transfusion of blood contaminated with HIV and from a mother to the child during gestation and delivery.

Observed inverse associations between intake of dairy products and colorectal cancer development have been largely attributed to their high calcium content. In addition to calcium, lactic acid-producing bacteria may also protect against colorectal cancer,

while the casein and lactose in milk may increase calcium bioavailability. Other nutrients or bioactive constituents in dairy products, such as lactoferrin, vitamin D (from fortified dairy products) or the short-chain fatty acid butyrate may also impart some protective functions against colorectal cancer, but these require much better elucidation.

Congress for many years		

Have members of the US Congress had salary increases since 1997?		
The second method, under which annual adjustments took effect automatically unless
disapproved by Congress, was established in 1975. From 1975 to 1989, these annual adjustments
were based on the rate of annual comparability increases given to the General Schedule (GS)
federal employees. This method was changed by the 1989 Ethics Act to require that the annual
adjustment be determined by a formula based on certain elements of the Employment Cost Index
(ECI). Under this revised process, annual adjustments were accepted 13 times (scheduled for
January 1991, 1992, 1993, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2009) and

Have members of the US Congress had salary increases since 1997?		
A third method for adjusting Member pay is congressional action pursuant to recommendations
from the President, based on the recommendations of the Citizens’ Commission on Public Service
and Compensation established in the 1989 Ethics Reform Act. Although the Citizens’
Commission was to have convened in 1993, it did not and has not met since then.

It is believed originally to have been part of a more elaborate routine, known in the British Army as ‘tattoo', that had its origins in the 17th century. During the evening, a duty officer had to do the rounds of his unit's position, checking that the sentry posts were manned, rounding up the off-duty soldiers and packing them off to their beds or billets. He would be accompanied by one or more musicians. The ‘first post' was sounded when the duty officer started his rounds and, as the party proceeded from post to post, a drum was played. The drum beats told off-duty soldiers it was time to rest. If the soldiers were staying in a town, the beats told them it was time to quit the pubs.

WSU researchers recently reported that diallyl sulfide, a compound found in garlic, is 100 times more effective than the antibiotics erythromycin and ciprofloxacin in killing the toxic bacteria Campylobacter jejuni.		

How does the garlic compound diallyl sulfide kill bacteria?		
The garlic compound diallyl sulfide is able to dissolve the biofilm and kill the cowering bacteria underneath 'Campylobacter jejuni' which is hard to kill because it produces a slimy protective biofilm that helps it repels antibiotics and stick to surfaces. 

Campylobacter jejuni is the most common cause of food poisoning in the United States. Food poisoning strikes over 2.4 million Americans each year and symptoms include stomach pains, cramping, diarrhea and fever.

Diallyl sulfide combines with a sulfur containing enzyme in the bacteria.  This changes the enzyme’s function and shuts down cell metabolism; killing bacteria better and faster than antibiotics!

How is Aids Transmitted?		
The following are the means by which the HIV virus is spread:

Vertical transmission. HIV can be spread to babies born to, or breastfed by, mothers infected with the virus.

Sexual contact. In adults and adolescents, HIV is spread most commonly by sexual contact with an infected partner. The virus enters the body through the lining of the vagina, vulva, penis, rectum, or abraded or irritated tissues in the lining of the mouth through sexual activity.

Blood contamination. HIV may also be spread through contact with infected blood. However, due to the screening of donated blood for evidence of HIV infection, the risk of acquiring HIV from blood transfusions is extremely low.

Needles. HIV is frequently spread by sharing needles, syringes, or drug use equipment with someone who is infected with the virus. Transmission from patient to health care worker, or vice-versa, through accidental sticks with contaminated needles or other medical instruments, is rare.

No known cases of HIV/AIDS have been spread by the following:

Saliva

Sweat

Tears

Casual contact, such as sharing food utensils, towels, and bedding

Swimming pools

Telephones

Toilet seats

Biting insects (such as mosquitoes)		

Can you catch Aids by eating something with an infected persons blood on it?		
No, As per the report on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one cannot get HIV from consuming food handled by someone with HIV. Even if the food contained small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus. Though it is very rare, HIV can be spread by eating food that has been pre-chewed by someone with HIV. The contamination occurs when infected blood from a caregiver’s mouth mixes with food while chewing. The only known cases are among infants.

Other factors that increase the risk of vaginal yeast infections include stress, washing your genitals with soap, wearing synthetic and tight clothes, sweating and using “non-breathable” panty liners or sanitary pads.		

Can wearing sanitary pads for too long lead to cancer		
It is true that synthetic materials of the types used in some high-absorbency feminine sanitary products can trap heat and dampness, which may promote the growth of yeast and bacteria and (in rare cases) create the potential for toxic shock syndrome, but that issue is associated with the use of tampons rather than sanitary pads		

Can wearing sanitary pads for too long lead to cancer		
According to Dr Aruna Kalra, mostly, sanitary pads are safe to use, however, there are a few ongoing studies that have reported the incidence of genital cancer with the use of sanitary pads that use absorptive agents like dioxin and super-absorbent polymers, because the nature of the dioxin (present in sanitary pads) can get accumulated in the body, and impact our reproductive organs, which can cause cervical cancer or ovarian cancer

The health benefits of black garlic are almost the same as white garlic BUT the fermentation process is said to enhance even further the amazing properties of the “regular” one. In a way it can be considered a kind of super-garlic. Or, in mathematical terms, as a to square white garlic.
The compound S-allylcysteine, a natural component of fresh garlic and a derivative of the amino acid cysteine, is found in much greater concentrations in black garlic. This compound is thought to help lower cholesterol and decrease the risk of cancer.
White garlic is praised throughout the world for its anti-microbial, antibiotic and anti-fungal. All properties that are attributed to allicin. Black garlic’s S-allycysteine improves the absorption of allicin, boosting protection against infections.

To date, and after much research performed, no adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies. Health-related conclusions are drawn from studies performed across the entire radio spectrum but, so far, only a few studies have been carried out at the frequencies to be used by 5G.

Tissue heating is the main mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency fields and the human body. Radiofrequency exposure levels from current technologies result in negligible temperature rise in the human body.

As the frequency increases, there is less penetration into the body tissues and absorption of the energy becomes more confined to the surface of the body (skin and eye). Provided that the overall exposure remains below international guidelines, no consequences for public health are anticipated.		

Does 5G reduce immunity and cause COVID-19?		
No, Claims state 5G weakens the immune system, making it easier to contract COVID-19, or that it directly causes the virus. Simply put, research emphasizes that the belief that 5G causes or can spread COVID-19 isn’t true.

While serving as Minister of Transport and Communications, Finland's new prime minister Sanna Marin, floated the idea of a flexible 6-hour, 4-day workweek that was slammed by members of the political opposition, which called the idea ""unrealistic"". Whether or not that goal is on her agenda as the head of state remains an open question.		

Is Finland is going to have a four-day working week and six-hour days?		
August 2019
SANNA MARIN (SDP), the Minister of Transport and Communications, made a bold working life-related proposal during a panel discussion held in conjunction with the 120th anniversary celebrations of the Social Democratic Party in Turku on Saturday.

Marin identified a considerably shorter work week as one of the objectives the party should incorporate into its agenda and pursue in the future.

“A four-day work week, a six-hour workday. Why couldn’t it be the next step? Is eight hours really the ultimate truth? I believe people deserve to spend more time with their families, loved ones, hobbies and other aspects of life, such as culture. This could be the next step for us in working life,” she stated.		

Is Finland is going to have a four-day working week and six-hour days?		
January 2020
Sanna Marin, a social democrat, who took office in December, leads a broad coalition that also includes greens, leftists and centrists.

“I believe people deserve to spend more time with their families, loved ones, hobbies and other aspects of life, such as culture,” she had previously said at her party's conference in the autumn of 2019.

“This could be the next step for us in working life.”

While the idea is not government policy under her coalition administration, her recent support for the radical move raises the prospect that Finland could eventually become the latest country to experiment with cutting working hours.

Article: Cases of Covid-19 in the summer were 16 TIMES higher in the UK than official figures suggest - with more than 5 MILLION Britons infected by the end of August, study claims		

According to the Daily Mail article, what is the calculated Infection Fatality Rate from the study?		
1%		

How were the numbers in the study arrived at?		
A technique called 'backcasting' was used to calculate the number of cases in 15 countries based on the number of deaths.		

What is backcasting?		
Backcasting means starting first with the desired outcome in mind and then identifying present-day actions to move in the direction of that outcome.		

Are IFRs for Covid-19 reliable?		
Large-scale outbreaks of infectious diseases such as COVID-19, known as epidemics, can be monitored via statistics like the probability of death once infected, or infection fatality ratio (IFR). Measuring the levels of antibodies (proteins produced by the immune system to target the virus) in peoples’ blood can show how many have been previously infected. The number of deaths and infections are used to calculate the IFR, but this calculation is challenging due to time delays during the natural course of illness as well as imperfect antibody tests and declining antibody levels over time.		

Did the article in the Daily Mail reach a best estimate of IFR?		
Yes, Data from previous studies was gathered to allow researchers to create a best estimate on time from infection to death and infection fatality rate,

Fatality rate changes based on a patient's age and any comorbidities, but by reviewing 26 studies the researchers settled on a percentage of 0.76 per cent.

Are sniffer dogs being used to detect Covid-19?		
There is variation in how well individual dogs perform, trial groups need to boost their sample sizes before the wider scientific community can evaluate how useful the dogs might be.		

What have studies found about sniffer dogs detecting COVID-19?		
A group in France, led by veterinary scientist Dominique Grandjean at the National Veterinary School of Alfort near Paris, posted its work3 on the preprint server bioRxiv in June. The researchers, who included Sarkis, trained 8 dogs to detect COVID-19 in 198 sweat samples, around half of which were from people with the disease. When these were hidden in a row of negative samples, the dogs identified the positive samples 83–100% of the time. The paper does not say how well the dogs identified negative test results. The research is now under review at a journal, but Grandjean says the process has not been easy. “To publish papers on detection dogs is very difficult because most reviewers do not know anything about working dogs,” he says.

The data in that study look promising, says Fyodor Urnov, a gene-editing scientist who is working on COVID testing at the University of California, Berkeley. But he would like to see larger data sets on how well dogs identify positive and negative samples. He also notes that there is variation in how well individual dogs perform. In Grandjean’s study, for example, 2 dogs identified 68 out of 68 positive samples, whereas one missed 10 out of 57 cases.		

Do the studies find that using sniffer dogs to detect COVID-19 is useful?		
Groups need to boost their sample sizes before the wider scientific community can evaluate how useful the dogs might be, agrees James Logan, an infectious-disease researcher at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine who is training and studying COVID-19 dogs, including Storm, Maple and Asher. “It’s important not to go out too early with grand claims and small data sets,” he says.

3051,A no deal Brexit means we would have free trade with the world.,"What does free trade mean?		
Free trade is a trade policy that does not restrict imports or exports. It can also be understood as the free market idea applied to international trade.		

How would a no deal Brexit affect the UK's trade agreements?		
Trade agreements that the UK is part of as an EU member state will no longer apply if there’s a no-deal Brexit.

The UK government is working on new agreements to replace EU trade agreements after Brexit.		

How much would the UK have to pay if there was a no deal Brexit?		
With no deal, it’s uncertain how much of that we’d have to pay, if anything.		

Would a no deal brexit mean we would have free trade with the world?		
The UK could import goods and services freely following a no-deal Brexit. But its exports would still be subject to other countries’ import regulations.

3052,A Facebook post claims that a no deal Brexit would mean no more uncontrolled immigration.,"In what way would the UK have control over immigration if it left the EU with a no deal?		
As a non member of the European Union, the UK would no longer be obliged to follow EU rules on freedom of movement within the member states.		

What control would the UK have over EU immigration if a withdrawal agreement is passed?		
If UK Prime Minister Theresa May's draft withdrawal agreement was passed the government would end the free movement of people between the UK and EU after the end of the transition period.		

What would the main difference be from a United Kingdom border that was no longer part of the European Union?		
As a non member of the European Union, the UK would no longer be obliged to follow EU rules on freedom of movement within the member states.		

What does 'freedom of movement' mean in relation to the European Union?		
Freedom of movement and residence for persons in the European Union is the cornerstone of EU citizenship, established by the Treaty of Maastricht in 1992. The gradual phasing-out of internal borders under the Schengen agreements was followed by the adoption of Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of EU citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the EU.		

How would the United Kingdom control immigration upon leaving the EU?		
There will no longer be one immigration system for non-Europeans, and another for EU citizens . The future
system will apply in the same way to all nationalities – EU and non-EU citizens alike – except where there are objective grounds to differentiate. 

Following the advice of the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), we will prioritise skilled migrants. A skilled-based migration policy will ensure the UK remains a hub for international talent from the EU and the rest of the world, which attracts people to work in our vibrant and diverse communities in jobs that drive up productivity and wages, and deliver essential services.		

Did the United Kingdom already have powers to control EU immigration pre-Brexit?		
The UK is not part of the Schengen passport-free area because it hasn’t signed the Schengen agreement.

Part of the Schengen agreement means the 26 signatories agree to not carry out border checks between each other. For example, you can drive from France to Belgium with no checks, because the assumption is that Belgium is happy to let in anyone that France was also happy to let in.

That’s not the case with the UK. If you travel from France to the UK or vice-versa, your passport will be checked.

3057,Using the air conditioning (AC) in a vehicle consumes more fuel.,"How can the use of air conditioning (AC) in a vehicle reduce fuel consumption?		
Running your car's air conditioning is the main contributor to reduced fuel economy in hot weather. Its effect depends on a number of factors, such as the outside temperature, humidity, and intensity of the sun. Under very hot conditions, AC use can reduce a conventional vehicle's fuel economy by more than 25%, particularly on short trips.1,2,3 The AC's effect on hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and electric vehicles (EVs) can be even larger on a percentage basis.2		

How does vehicle air conditioning (AC) work?		
... the air conditioning system uses the following parts:

Compressor — compresses the refrigerant into a fluid, so the liquid refrigerant flows through a line to the condenser.
Condenser — removes the heat from the refrigerant and pushes it along to the expansion valve or orifice tube.
Expansion valve or orifice tube — returns the refrigerant to its original gaseous state and moves it to the receiver/drier or accumulator.
Receiver/drier or accumulator — removes moisture from the refrigerant and transfers it to the evaporator.
Evaporator — pulls heat from the air passing through its core and transfers it into the refrigerant, resulting in cold air flowing beyond the evaporator.		

Can using a vehicle's air conditioning (AC) be fuel-efficient?		
Yes, According to the EPA, using your car’s AC can be more efficient while driving at highway speeds than having the windows open. Open windows elevate aerodynamic drag, causing the engine to work harder and burn more fuel.		

Does a vehicle's air conditioning (AC) waste less gas while driving at highway speeds?		
Yes, As long as the AC is used while driving at highway speeds, the AC won't waste gas.		

Does using your car's AC consume more fuel		
Using the AC in your car does lower your car’s fuel efficiency by an average of 3 miles per gallon depending on the age and size of your car. AC lowers your fuel efficiency because it is diverting energy from the engine to power the car. The fuel to power the AC has to come from somewhere, and the engine is the most efficient way for the AC to get its energy.

If you’re driving at high speeds, leaving your windows down can actually lower your fuel efficiency more than using your AC would. Lowering your windows can lower your fuel efficiency because the wind entering your car creates a drag that forces your car to work harder to get to the same speed if the windows were rolled up.

there is no evidence that 5G is harmful to humans. 5G is the next generation of wireless network technology, following on from 4G. Like 4G, 3G and 2G before it, 5G mobile data is transmitted over radio waves—a small part of the whole electromagnetic spectrum (which includes microwaves, visible light and X-rays).		

Are the radio waves transmitted by 5g damaging to the body?		
These radio waves are non-ionising, meaning they don’t damage the DNA inside cells, as X-rays, gamma rays and UV rays are able to do. 5G, although at slightly higher frequencies than previous networks, is still in this radio part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Public Health England has said that there’s no “convincing evidence” that exposure below International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation guidelines can cause adverse health effects. These guidelines go up to 300GHz, whereas the maximum for 5G will probably only be in the tens of GHz.
